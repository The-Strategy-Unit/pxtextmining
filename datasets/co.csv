"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","I phoned the crisis team in the early hours of the morning. It had already taken me an hour to pluck up the courage to phone. I was very distressed and frightened and didn't know quite what to say or do as my mind was racing. I explained I felt very low and had thoughts to end my life. The Crisis worker was abrupt and the tone of voice gave the impression that they really couldn't be bothered to talk to me in my hour of need. They were quite patronising and made me feel worse. I was assured that someone would call me the following day to arrange an appointment with my psychiatrist. Three days passed and nobody called. It's now the weekend. I'm still in a state of distress but I will always think twice before even contemplating contacting the crisis team again. Every time I've called them in the past I have tended to receive an uncaring and patronising response. This isn't good enough.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",0

When I first started working with her I found some things really difficult like bed times and my children's behavior I can now say I can handle these things brilliant thank-you to her help also I now know my children are safe at all times around the house with her tips and advise how to keep my children safe.  
I was really anxious about going into children's groups at the children centres and with all her encouragement and support I now go to two children's groups twice a week AND feel comfortable. I felt I could talk to her about anything and she always supported my decisions and choices about I felt would help me be the best person and being a mother. Although I now go to groups and she no longer comes to my home I still see her at the enter and she's always up for a chat if I need it she'll never be pushy for you to tell her anything but she's a really good listener and will give you the best advice.

Julie is very easy to talk to and has given my husband and myself reassurance that we are not on our own.

I was also offered the opportunity to take part in additional courses, such as Paediatric First Aid and Speech and language courses.  
Once we had completed the training I was able to meet new mums to offer support and someone to talk to, in the early days of bringing home a new baby.  
I really enjoyed my time volunteering at Hawtonville Children's Centre and the new skills and confidence that I gained whilst being a volunteer have helped me to apply for jobs and I am happy to say I start in a new role as a one to one teaching assistant very soon.","1","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",13
"cs","Care received","Advice and support","My child has always had very little water confidence. We went to swimming lessons as a baby but he didn’t take to them very well at all so we stopped. He is now 3 and I started to get concerned about the safety aspect of him not being able to swim, particularly after he fell into a pond whilst on holiday.  
It was my family who suggested that I bring him along to the SureStart swimming during the summer holidays so that he could learn from his cousins.  
My sister and sister in law regularly attend the sessions during term time and spoke very highly of them. Within just 2 weeks the progress he made was amazing and you could see that instead of clinging onto an adult for dear life, he was starting to relax and have moments of swimming independently.  
This gave me the confidence to join my son back up to some swimming lessons. He had to initially join a toddler group so that his daddy could go in the pool. By the end of the 6 weeks holidays he could swim by himself and actually enjoyed splashes due to the fun sessions that SureStart had offered.  
After being back at school for just 2 weeks my son has moved up swimming groups with no adults in or on the pool side, last Saturday he swam a width doing backstroke. I cannot thank you all enough for the help and encouragement you gave to my son who can now swim :)","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",14
"cc","Care received","Care received","""Join me on the set of Mr Sillyberk's new blockbuster mover - Sure Start, Stay and play you wonderful one's."" ""First of all Mr Sillyberk, a big thank you for this interview. Could you tell us more about your movie?""  
""Sure;""  
The movie opens with a panoramic shot of an ancient castle, surrounded by a moat in which a friendly crocodile resides. Shortly, an army of little princes and princesses arrive - walls being to tumble and then are rebuilt. ""Help"", ""help"" cries a small plastic figure of a girl, ""I’m trapped on top of the parapet wall and I need a fire engine to rescue me"". ""I am on my way sweetheart"" cries a trainee fireman - ladders extended, the terrified figure is rescued!!""  
Elsewhere........ In the kitchen, meals are prepared by enthusiastic chefs. Dough, carefully rolled out flat, cut and shaped. Pasta tubes weighed and spooned on to plates. Microwave doors open...'ping' - ""it’s ready"". The tension is beginning to build. Anxious little faces stare at the dinners. Will it be properly cooked? Did it spend too much time in the microwave? Will it be al dente? ""Perfecto"", - signs of relief from the chefs. You are awarded the Micheline Star!! Meanwhile...on a rough sea of red water, a small flotilla of boats battle through the torrents of red water. Sharks lurk menacingly below the waves, ready to grab a meal of an overboard sailor - ""grab a meal?"" ""No! No! We just want to play hide and seek"", a bemused shark shouts.  
The film then takes us to the artistic quarter. ""No darling, that’s too much glue, and you don’t need to overdo the glitter!!"" ""Breathe deeply mother, I know what I am doing. I am in the moment - you can never, and I mean never, have too much glitter. Keep the faith, after all, my creations hang on every fridge of every relative I have. No Grandad and Grandma wouldn’t display them if they had too much glitter would they?"" The Pace of the film now really begins to pick up. Beep Beep, watch out - coming through - trikes, tractors and turbo charged cars transverse in every direction. Covered dollies in pushchairs brave the traffic. ""I can do it"" - ""I don’t need your hand"". Wobbly legs cross the stepping stones, up the green steps, then over the orange bridge - a quick rendition of 'I’m the king of the castle' once on top, followed by the treacherous descent of the slippery slope and onto the final jump! Hold tight, see saw Marjory daws. A goal!!! Put the ball through the net. Yeah- hands clap together, faces smile and laughter begins to fill the air.  
""Now Mr Sillyberk, who have you cast in this action, adventure, romcom, thriller, musical film?"" ""Well, my production team constructs and then lays out the set - a set which changes on a daily basis. The magic can only start when the local children arrive - they engage their imagination and new scenes begin to develop for the chaos, I just observe and note it"".  
""So, tell me about the production team?"" ""The first thing to say is that they are all professional and passionate about their work. It would be impossible to maintain the high standards they so consistently achieve. This is not merely a job and I am not sure they realise this. This room is always immaculately prepared and obviously well thought out. Testament to this is the state of the room at near ""Stop what you are doing and show me your hands - it’s time to tidy up"". Demolished beyond recognition would be a fair description. I feel more proof if needed, that the children have had a good time for have been actively engaged with all areas of the room and outside.  
And so to the members of the team:  
Tracey: Impressive, efficient, warm and welcoming – the first to inquire about my grandson in a morning. He’s at ease with her and trusts her – often engaging in conversation – a greater recommendation I could not imagine! A big thank you to the interview team who appointed her. Karen: Ticks all the boxes. I absolutely love to see the interaction between C and Karen. Always asks at the end of each session if anyone has any requests for play at next session, and, most importantly delivers! Good at the visual side of singing, great use of props to embellish the song, and not afraid to take advice from a 3 year old! – Zoom not Whoosh!  
Becky: If C had a favourite and must emphasise ‘if’ – it would be Becky. C will always ask before we set off “will Becky be there?” Now I must admit, this may be out of fear, but if how they interact, once they meet, I know you can dismiss the ‘fear’. Not afraid to correct the children, even when the children’s own carer fails to do so. Listens to and never over-talks the children. But Becky, bright pink Doc Martins – really?!?!?!  
Kieren: Her greatest skill is the ability to talk to children on their own level – not as easy as you may think. Away for a while with a poorly arm. However, I guess the lure of the children drew her back – probably too early. Now that’s dedication for you. Hope your arm is better, after all – those snacks aren’t going to prepare themselves!  
Paula: Along with Tracy, never fails to ask after C’s morning – “How many tractors, buses and fire engines have you seen today?” A genuine question that is important to him. C is keen to share this information, often adding what colour and whether they were single or double decker.  
Some of your critics have said, and I quote ‘This is just another remake of Kindergarten Cop’. Not at all. Unlike Kindergarten Cop, this film is about the children and the adults play a secondary role. However, where it does mimic Kindergarten Cop is that it does have a beginning, middle and an end. Always full of drama, comedy, thrills and sometimes romance, but most importantly, finishes on a happy ending. Food and drink!  
I once read that even the smallest person can make a big difference, to all these individual, adorable and talented little people, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have collectively made a big difference to me, and in a positive way. Now I will be the first to admit C and I suspect all of his playmates, are no way little angels all of the time, but isn’t this what growing up is all about? Testing boundaries? Pushing limits? We need the naughty to make the good memorable. It’s down to us, as adults to guide and steer our little ones in a direction that is acceptable to society and society will fall if we neglect to put the effort into showing our little ones good examples. Enough of this serious stuff.  
C (and is grandad) began this incredible journey of enlightenment almost two years ago. The only baby in a room full of toddlers. The interaction between children and children, and children and adults was a joy for me to observe. For the first time I was able to watch this without the pressures of being a young father and husband – what have I been missing?  
Back to the interview….”now I understand the film finishes on a musical note?”  
“Yes, quite true”. “The big sing song as I like to call it, songs from our childhood – a symphony of sound, marching, clapping and arms aloft. What a good way to shake our sillies out after an action packed day”.  
“And finally Mr Sillyberk, I understand the catering is legendary?” “Yes, the best kept secret on the set. A chance to bring the excitement levels down, to share a snack, experience new foods they may not have tried, before getting in to their stretched limo pushchairs and onto a new experience.  
So, a big, big thank you to all the cast members of SureStart, some at the coal face, others working behind the scenes. And on behalf of my wonderful grandson C, thank you for all the stickers, thank you for all the snacks but most of all, thank you for all the fun!

"cl","Care received","Made A Difference To My Life","I am a postgraduate of the Nottingham Recovery College in Duncan Macmillan House, Nottingham. I am a recovering drug, solvent and alcohol user with mental health issues, at this time I am stable and sober and clean of drugs.  
I did initially go to the Nottingham Recovery College for 6 weeks in approximately 2012 , but left. I think it wasn't my time then. I went back to my old back habits of isolating myself and not talking to people in the community, also seeking comfort in junk food and tobacco. My weight shot up to 18st 1 pound. I used a walking stick and could hardly bend down to tie my shoe laces. Sinking into a deeper hole of depression than I had ever been in before.  
I decided to start again as a student at the Nottingham Recovery College on the first day of the educational year of 2015-2016. I attended all of the subjects I chose in the 3 terms of my academic year - graduating in July 2016. After this, I went on to Summer School also held at the Nottingham Recovery College. I took a great course called ""Spirituality In Recovery - Advanced Level"" with a lovely tutor called Katja.  
I achieved certification in many personal development courses which helped with my own lived experience of having both mental and physical health issues. I learnt many coping strategies and techniques and also have lots of courses to put on my CV. Being able to include these on my CV, I believe, has made my CV stronger for applying for volunteering and/or paid work in the community in the future.  
The tutors at the college educated me and had a caring and understanding approach to all students within the Nottingham Recovery College. I personally could relate to other students and I learnt a lot from their input in the classes, which I found helpful.  
I would recommend this valuable educational Nottingham Recovery College to all types of people in the community. Thank you so much Nottingham Recovery College for helping me.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",21
"cl","Care received","Made A Difference To My Life","I could have written the review by JustAnotherServiceUser myself - I would also use the words 'abrupt', 'patronising' and 'couldn't be bothered' to describe my experience of speaking to Notts Crisis Team. I rang in a very distressed state after an incident at home, feeling worthless, desperate and like I didn't deserve to live.  
It took some courage to ring Crisis Team and the conversation got off to a bad start straight away with the call operator mishearing my name and saying some random words that sounded a bit like my name in a sarcastic tone, as if it was funny. I nearly put the phone down there and then. I can't remember the specifics of the conversation as I was so distressed, but I started feeling worse and worse about myself as it went on, feeling like I was just an irritation to the call operator.  
The situation escalated and I ended up being detained and sectioned by the police. I can't judge whether this was the right course of action or not and I don't resent Crisis Team for calling them, it's just how they spoke to me that stays with me. I am a sensitive person and when in crisis, the way I'm spoken to can make a difference to the outcome. I would expect Crisis Team to understand that; basic compassion was lacking.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",22

My GP has asked for updates regularly but again has nothing. He doesn’t know what to do and I feel he has given up on me. I feel abandoned and like I am just a burden on everybody.  
I’ve fought the urge to end it so hard. I tried to take my life recently. I ended up in a and e following an overdose. I called the crisis number before taking the pills. I was told I’d have to call another number. When I did I was promised a call back. I thought this might lead to some action.  
I believe the Rushcliffe team also misled people about my care saying that the Gp is fully aware of my support plan. Following the suicide attempt, I have been left without any medication.

"cs","Care received","Advice and support","I am absolutely disgusted with the care team at Millbrook hospital. My husband had been referred to the by his doctor because he is desperately in need to some in depth mental health care. He has been extremely suicidal for the past six months and the doctors have tried to treat him for over a decade without success. He needs specialist treatment but the doctors at Millbrook hospital are refusing to even see him as apparently he is not ill enough.  
It feels like we have to wait for my husband to actually take his own life before they will look at anything. Never mind that he is in the age group where men are most likely to commit suicide. I hope someone at this hospital will be able to explain to my two children why their father wasn’t considered important enough for treatment if the worse happens. I think that if they had lived with this illness for as long as we have then I’m pretty certain they would be falling over themselves to treat him.

I have nothing but praise for their proficiency, help, kindness and consideration. They made an exhausting and difficult time bearable for my husband, myself and our family  
My husband was admitted to Lings Bar Hospital from the Queens Medical Centre on in September and discharged recently. He had fractured his right wrist in a fall at home which, combined with his Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and frequently interrupted nights, made caring for him at home exhausting and extremely difficult.  
The staff were exemplary. They listened to our concerns and took our view seriously. I saw them treat sometimes difficult patients well with patience and kindness. The food was good, well cooked, varied and nutritious: the resulting empty plates and accepted second helpings proof of the pudding and the clean, safe, airy wards created a pleasant atmosphere.  
Understandably when a person with a fractured limb/s is in hospital long term, sometimes for several months they can become unappreciative and resentful; even a five star hotel would not suit. But in my opinion, as a frequent visitor, I would say Lings Bar Hospital is one of the best places to be if that is what is needed.

Dr Daly was fantastic and went out of her way (she had been with me some time so no doubt she was behind with her other appointments) to contact the crisis team and took the time to make sure I was seen that day. I was referred to Highbury hospital.  
From the moment I met Zoe the psychologist she was so lovely, made me feel at ease and able to talk to her about my feelings & worries. For the first time that day I felt like I would get the help I needed. Zoe deserves so much credit for what she does and how she makes people like me feel.  
Zoe & the Doctor advised I stay at Haven house. This place is amazing! The staff have so much empathy and are so supportive. There is always someone to talk to or help you through difficult times of the day. They have all kinds of activities going on if you wanted to join in. I stayed for 7 days and in that time I still had visits from Zoe & some of the other members of the crisis team who are equally great at what they do. Zoe makes a plan and continues to look at ways to help me, whether it be through other organisations or self help.  
Even after returning home the support continues with visits & phonecalls to make sure I had everything I needed and some support with any worries I may have.

A chance to also meet other mums, fathers to be. I had no idea what to expect at first. The staff were kind, helpful, informative and made the class fun! No question was a silly question and believe me I asked a few :-)  
It helped us prepare for the birth and those first few precious weeks. Newborn fog really can cause baby brain but I remembered the vital points of skin to skin, latching, the frantic feeding on day 3 etc..  
However, the birth didn't work out how I envisioned. I ended up with an emergency C-section and suffered a bleed requiring blood transfusions, missing out on skin to skin at first. My milk was delayed. By day 11 I had some milk but was playing catch up with formula. Formula saved my child's life. He was jaundice requiring treatment. I carried on breastfeeding through the difficult first 6 weeks with added mobility complications and it was pain free and enjoyable.  
Helped mostly by support from our local SureStart BABES group (Mansfield Titchfield and Oakham) Sandra and the group have helped me, non-judgmentally and supported my decisions throughout. My breastfeeding journey would have ended much sooner. The advice they have given me has helped my Son grow into a healthy little boy, and strengthened our bond through the joy of breastfeeding.

It's a shame the class doesn't run for 1.5 hours and it would benefit fir more comfortable seating as with my arthritic knees and back I'm not very good sitting on the floor or a hard seat!  
I also like the fact that unlike other medical opinions in breast feeding the sure start team are positive about combination feeding as my low milk supply means I mainly bottle feed and top up with breast feeds. I haven't been told to just 'give up the breast feeding' as lost people have told me so the group help to lift my spirits when I'm feeling down about not being able to exclusively breast feed.

"ee","Environment/ facilities","Environment/ facilities","I attended the Wellbeing for Mums Course, Hawtonville Children’s Centre, Newark-on-Trent. I was referred for this course because I had been suffering postnatal depression and other difficulties after fleeing an abusive relationship. My son was extremely clingy as a result of this, and I had never left him in anyone else’s care.  
I was extremely nervous about the first session, particularly how my son would cope being left in the crèche. However, he already knew some of the staff running the crèche from when we had attended sessions at the children’s centre in the past, and I believe this helped him to settle in more easily.  
The room was arranged in a relaxing and informal way with fairy lights and large cushions on the floor to sit on, which instantly made it feel welcoming and relaxing. There were a wide range of activities to participate in, with an alternative available if you did not want to do that particular activity. There was no pressure to chat, which I liked as I am a naturally shy person, but I found myself taking part in conversations as I felt at ease in that setting.  
Overall, I really enjoyed the course and would do it again if I had the chance. It gave me time and space away from my son to think and clear my mind, which in turn helped me to appreciate the time I have with him even more. It has also encouraged me to try new activities, and as a result of the course, we now attend a parent-toddler yoga class.

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","After a disastrous stay on Minster ward at Newark Hospital, part of Sherwood Forest NHS Trust, I decided to look elsewhere for my podiatric treatment and am so glad I found this clinic.
I was very quickly offered an appointment following referral, the staff including reception staff, clinic staff, nursing and medical staff are all excellent and my treatment was quickly planned and organised.
I was never kept waiting at my out-patient appointments as the (admittedly small) clinic ran smoothly and to time and I was fully informed with regards to my choices over treatment and planned surgery including aftercare.
The surgery went well and I am very pleased with the results.
What impressed me most was how the theatre staff were fully informed about my drug intolerance; I was given a red wristband with my intolerance clearly written on which meant I was not prescribed drugs I could not have.
Only downside is the horrendously small car park which is clearly unsuitable for the number of people using the wide range of clinic services offered in this building.
With the exception of the car park, I simply could not find fault if I tried.
Due to this being a clinic and not a hospital I cannot comment on the issue of same sex accommodation as there are no wards or hospital rooms patients stay in before or after treatment, just a small waiting area before being taken to the changing room then into the pre-op room then into theatre, and back to pre-op for final checks before being discharged.

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","For some years I have been treated at the Stonebridge Centre. Recently I've had some worrying encounters with the psychiatrists there and was advised to speak to the PALS team, I did this and was told the PALS team would call me back but they have not done so.  
My first concern is that my dosage has been reduced without the psychiatrist talking to me about it. The medication I receive was set at a slightly higher dose as my original psychiatrist felt it would help to prevent hospitalisation, something that kept happening previously. The level of the dose meant that it could only be prescribed by a qualified psychiatrist, by reducing the dose I could get the medication from my GP. When I spoke to my CPN about the reduced dose she said that it should not have been reduced without me being aware of it beforehand.  
Secondly, a psychiatrist recently asked if I practised mindfulness and if so for how long and when. I explained I spent 40 minutes each evening doing mindfulness as I had been taught. They dismissed this saying it was wrong and that I should be doing it 4 times a day for shorter periods, they were not prepared to hear that my method has worked for me for a considerable time. They also asked if I went to church, going on to make a comment about paedophiles. I felt this was totally inappropriate.  
I spoke to this psychiatrist about EMDR and Distress Management, they were not familiar with either treatment regime and just asked if was an American concept.

it was good to see talent from own team and other teams taking part in the positive goals league, especially from Phil the Activity Coordinator with his goals, and other patients sharing 5 goals and I managed to get a goal!

But I did it and played well, enjoyed it and had a great time, and will have a great memory and experience to take away with me.  
This helps with confidence, and will build up my character, I'm sure. and it gives another experience to combat times when you feel low, insecure or anxious, vulnerable and helpless.

"cr","Care received","Rules/approach to care","During pregnancy I was quite open minded about feeding, I wanted to breast feed but if I couldn't then that was fine. When I was 37 weeks pregnant I went to an antenatal class at sure start which was led by a lady called Kat. It was such a useful session, Kat gave us such knowledge on breast feeding, brain development and bonding. She gave me the confidence to believe that l could breast feed and she would be there if I struggled. My daughter was born and feeding didn't come very naturally, on day 3 Kat came after being asked by my midwife. She arrived and was interested in my birth and feeding journey so far, she gave me so much help and support and made me feel so comfortable. Kat came a few times and she would keep in regular contact with myself after weigh ins with my midwife and health visitor. She really was so supportive and I can honestly say that I wouldn't still be breast feeding had it not been for Kat's amazing, support, guidence and expertise. I've been to a few breast feeding groups at sure start so I still have regular contact with her. She needs to be cloned, everyone needs Kat to support in their breast feeding journey. I feel really angry when people don't get support, I feel very fortunate. She is friendly, professional, supportive and down to earth... she's a credit to the health visiting team in Mansfield. My daughter is now 15 weeks and 5 days and I'm still breast feeding!","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",105

"dp","Dignity","Involvement: Of Service Users/Patients","- More patient interaction with staff would be good. when staff are busy, that is understandable but when you see 4 or 5 staff (nurses and HCAs) having a chat and a hot drink in the office and laughing together, it makes us as patients wonder why they don't come to sit in communal areas and chat with us too.  
- I think staff shouldn't have conversations about patients within earshot of other patients. Twice now a particular member of staff has been heard saying not very nice things about myself around other patients. Also staff can be regularly heard saying similar things about other members of staff and I don't think this is okay.  
- I have never seen, heard of or know about my care plans or goal settings. I was told when I first came that a care plan would be written but I haven't ever been told anything further and I have now been here for over 4 months.  
- Sometimes if you are distressed or struggling, some nurses refuse to give you PRN medication. I know it is as nurse's discretion but I do not ask for it unless I need it and sometimes being told that you cannot have it because you were fine half an hour before is frustrating because with my diagnosis, my mood can switch in seconds and not being able to access PRN can lead to incidents and an even lower mood.  
+ If we have a problem on the ward, the ward manager Kirsty always has time for us and will help us sort things if there is something that can be done.  
+ Community meetings every week are a good way of raising any environmental issues on the ward and any issues get sorted as quickly as possible.  
+ My named nurse is really supportive and will always try to make time for me when she on shift if I am struggling or need to talk. I trust her a lot which is important to me.  
+ The activity co-ordinators that come on to the ward are also incredibly supportive and will stop to have a chat or a 1:1 with you if they have time in between activities.

All resources are being given to Breckon ward (ICU) which is meant to support parents with greatest needs, yet half the patients in there are only there as there is no bed else where and the patients that would benefit from that extra support are all stuck on treatment wards.

Because they had a hard time making those sounds, people had a hard time understanding them and have asked them to repeat themselves and had looked to me for help with understanding them. This had obviously affected their self esteem and made them not want to speak to others, especially other adults and teachers. After doing some of the speech and language exercises and using the tools learnt in the course sessions, their speech improved immensely and they gained confidence to put up their hands and speak up in class and answer questions. They are now both in drama class loving to act and get up in front of the audience. They have really done so well in school and have really thrived. The course teachers, Sue and Lara, were both very knowledgeable and presented the course work in an engaging and inclusive manner.

"cr","Care received","Rules/approach to care","I am a carer of someone who is in Rampton Hospital. I am fairly new to the mental health platform as my son fell ill after completing university. He has been in Rampton for about 4 years.  
I get a sense that the environment is not conducive to encouraging hope. When the treatment of mental health has moved on into the 21st Century, I'm not sure if the ""ethos"" in Rampton has. A member of staff just recently remarked to me that in Rampton they medicate, not rehabilitate! Surely, the two should go hand in hand.  
A Sainsbury Foundation Study points to ""hope"" as one of 5 key processes to recovery : Connectedness, Hope, Identity,Meaning, Empowerment.  
I feel the ethos within the hospital needs some clarification- perhaps by the leadership and managers. The CQC has certainly identified this as an issue.  
To be specific, Tai Chi was recently trialled in Rampton! This was indeed a milestone (thanks to an enlightened Head of Security) . But it was trialled for ONE day! And patients would have to pay £5 to do it if they continue! This is despite several staff members expressing interest in doing it themselves. Carers must draw their own conclusions.  
Communication with carers, now that the Triangle of Care has been signed up to, needs to be expanded. Putting news in the INTOUCH leaflet is not enough. Besides, it has the flavour of a Staff Newsletter. Carers were not involved or informed about projects till after the events. As some carers have commented there were no visual ""advertising"" of projects within the wards. Follow-up on the progression of these ""journeying"" projects would be greatly appreciated too. Carers can contribute trees and plants for these projects.  
Finally, the issue of going digital, much has been talked about, but carers would like reports on outcomes or even progression.

Due to difficulties with communication I have a plan on Rio. It is also documented in my notes that I know when I'm in crisis, that I don't contact crisis for no reason or just for a chat (whilst that may be useful for some patients it isn't to me).  
I proactively contacted the crisis team for support. I have had some text response but no actual action in terms of following my crisis plan.  
Previously I've only recieved support following multiple A&E admissions for medical treatment. I want to avoid that, everyone wants to avoid that. I do not understand why CRHT don't follow the plan. I don't think I'm a difficult patient and due to my ASD I'm very straightforward about my risks and what I think will and won't help.  
I was previously told by a member of your team that when you have contact with a patient you mentally put them in a box of manic/ psychotic/ personality disorder and that because I don't fit any of these this is probably why I don't receive timely support.

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","I was at North Sea Camp and got released and went to a Salvation Army homeless shelter and they got me a home locally. I enjoyed North Sea Camp where we did a lot of work about safer custody and Governor Batchford worked with the inmates giving them the important jobs and lots of us running day to day activities. Trusted inmates got the good jobs and I ended up doing Charity Shop work in the community and college courses. It was something good to work for. We had mandatory drug tests and this reduced drug use.  
We had an officer who improved the reputation of the units and I became wing rep.  
I got sectioned a couple of years ago and ended up in Trust services. I'm on Redwood 1 and the nurses are lovely and healthcare assistants are good but some bank staff are not doing their jobs correctly.  
It means that some of the lads who are paranoid feel that the bank staff should be out on the wards more. I think we need a more diverse workforce more LGBT people working on the wards.  
We also need peer support ex forces workers to understand us. Disabled workers should be welcomed. Ex prison officers and military etc.  
We used to get newspapers in prison but we don't get them for the ward.  
We also need more control of the TV as there's not enough choice or remotes. Football to watch live matches would be good. It brings people together. We all get on together and we all get on when we watch.

Complaint involved my diagnosis, and no 1:1 trauma therapy, despite asking for many years and no support to taper medication, despite asking for years.  
Submitted complaint through the notts healthcare trust complaints - told full investigation had taken place and would get a full response by the following month, which is when I received an answer machine message and text messages from a senior member of staff asking me to consider dropping the formal complaint and have a case conference instead. I complained through email ( with advocate from pohwer copied in) to complaints department. I received an apology.  
Complaint re-investigated by an another staff member and received a full response at the end of the next month.  
Response full of inaccuracies. Responded to response pointing out the inaccuracies (backed up by my CPN). I was offered a local resolution meeting - therefore I couldn't take it to the ombudsman. 3 months after the response at the local resolution meeting - asked for the meeting to be digitally recorded and transcribed as a reasonable adjustment under the disability discrimination act. I attended a meeting with my advocate, CPN, CPN manager and a someone from the complaints department. Meeting was recorded, promises were made. Week or so after, I received an email with a file containing a digital recording. - couldn't open the file and my CPN couldn't open the file. Emailed complaints with screenshots saying "" can't open"" file stated only had so many attempts to open it and file wouldn't auto delete after so many days.  
The next month I received email from complaints department, stating the local resolution meeting had only been partially recorded - last half not recorded - due to human error. Still waiting for transcript and digital recording of 1st part of meeting.

"co","Care received","1-2-1 care/Time spent with service user","My admission into Millbrook was a roller-coaster of a time. There would be days when staff would seem to care and make time to talk to you and then weeks when patients would be left unable to even have 5 minutes to talk to somebody when they were struggling.  
Admittedly is not the fault of the staff, but not enough was done to prevent drugs from coming in. I think staff knew about it but there was nothing they could. Several times I was verbally attacked by several patients when they were suffering from withdrawal from the drugs; my life was threatened, I was called all sorts of horrible names which triggered incidents for me and I even had to run to my bedroom to hide from one of the patients when they was being aggressive towards me because I feared for my safety.  
I did not find the wards a therapeutic environment in any way shape or form. Some staff would talk in a negative way about other staff loud enough for patients like me and others to hear, staff would say equally negative things about other patients again within the ear shot of lots of people which I think is unprofessional and we as patients had a lot of conversations revolving around the fact that we didn't want to go to staff with any issues because we worried about what they were saying about us when we were not there.  
I felt my consultant on the ward told frequent lies. This knocked my faith in the entire system and made me disengage with the majority of people. I was prescribed a PRN medication by a doctor who worked with my psychiatrist and the nurses on shift one day decided to give me a lower dose despite me needing the higher dosage.  
There were coffee stains on the ceiling, blood stains left on the wall, holes in the walls, stagnant carpets, the smell of stale cigarettes, hair left in the bath, dirty cups everywhere and many other things which again I know is not the responsibility of the staff but made the ward feel grimy and not hospital like at all.  
I heard and observed certain members of staff being controlling, overly strict and sometimes pretty aggressive towards patients. There was someone on the ward who through no fault of their own could not look after their personal hygiene. I did not see staff help this person to change their clothes or prompt them to wash when they were starting to smell bad. It felt like this was a common occurrence on the ward. A lot of people did not shower or change their clothes for a long time and I think this should be the job of the staff to gently prompt people to maintain their own cleanliness as it is common for people with mental health conditions to struggle with this but nobody on the ward seemed to bother, despite the whole corridors near the bedrooms smelling quite bad sometimes too.  
On the occasions that I was struggling and felt able to approach staff for support I was more often than not told that they were too busy at that moment but would get back to me, which exclusively never happened and I was left without talking to anybody. Or I would be asked where my peers were on the ward and told to spend time with them instead which admittedly I would do a lot of the time but other patients I were close to also had their own mental health issues to deal with and should not be expected to support me through a crisis or a difficult time, this should be facilitated by staff. Peer support is important sometimes but relying on other patients to be the ones to talk to you when you had something on your mind or needed to talk about your mental health is not fair on them. This also happened in the reverse wherein other patients were told to come and find me when they were struggling which I do not mind about when I am feeling okay but when I was struggling myself, I was in no place to be supporting other people and found myself being occasionally triggered by other people's struggles. I feel that most of the staff do not have the time to spend with patients, even when they were struggling which is understandable when the ward was short staffed however when there would be extra staff not on observations or the door board, they would be most likely to be found sitting in the nursing office.  
This is not true for everybody however, the ward I was on did have some absolutely great staff who can't be faulted at all, however, those staff were usually on observations for pretty much all of the shift or running round after everyone. I know this story is mostly quite negative but I am just trying to give an honest review of the ward from a patients point of view. The ward did have some good points like great activity coordinators, plenty of communal spaces and a good range of books/dvds to keep people from getting bored but in all honesty, it was not a hugely positive place for me and I don't feel as if I made a lot of progress in my time there.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",230
"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","It took me over four decades to figure out that I have Asperger Syndrome. Four decades of not fitting anywhere, of struggling to understand things that always seem to be just out of reach, of coping with adverse reactions from others who couldn't possibly have understood why I don't do things the way everyone else does. So when the penny dropped, it was a massive relief. Finally I knew who I was.  
When I told my GP, she knew straight away that I'd hit the nail on the head.  Now to access services:  • To get assistance to identify all the areas of difficulty and work out corresponding new strategies.  
• To maybe get a little support to do the things I struggle to do on my own.  • To make contact with others who experience similar issues.  
The referral for assesment to Adult Mental Health at Bassetlaw Hospital occurred last summer, nearly 18 months ago.  
It has taken far too long, and I'm not impressed with the Quality of the Asperger's Assessment Service.  
I'll list some of the problems, which I hope someone will want to tackle :  
1. The name on the appointment letter is never the person you actually see. This raises expectations that you're going to see an expert, a specialist, when in fact you have to see a more junior member of staff.  
2. Seeing a less qualified clinician would not necessarily be a problem, some of the most therapuetic interactions tend to source from people who aren't qualified in anything other than being able to listen and willing to help. But it seems a little odd that in a specialist subject area I can get better knowledge and understanding from friends with zero qualifications.  
3. The 'assumed' clinician didn't tell me who they were or how they were qualified. Said they worked with Dr xxxx but didn't say in what capacity. They could have been the Office Cleaner for all I knew.  
4. I felt they pushed drugs in an overly persistent way. Despite repeated assertions from me that I don't want powerful medication. They kept trying to get me onto strong drugs, well before finishing the assessment. How can they know what treatment to suggest if they hasn't understood what my problems were? If I had been someone less able to resist such pressure I could easily have ended up over medicated. In any case, there aren't any medications for Asperger's since it's not an illness.  
5. They were very late for appointments 2 out of 5 times. Both times gave the same excuse that no-one told them I was there. Why do they not understand the definition of 'appointment'? It's when you agree to meet someone at a particular time in a particular place. I was there, why weren't they?  
6. Once attended an appointment where the clinician had no memory or record of our previous appointment. Insisted I hadn't seen them for 6 months, when in truth it was half this time. It seems the notes had been lost.  
7. My tests were completed a year before they got around to discussing the results with me. This has to be an unacceptable length of time. Apparently the tests aren't that difficult to score. It should only have taken maybe 10 minutes. If they had turned up to appointments on time, I could have helped them do their job.  
8. When I asked for Information about Asperger Syndrome & Self-Help Groups. I was told they hadn't told me what I have yet. Obviously offended because I already knew my diagnosis. Only very insecure clinicians are threatened by Service Users having access to knowledge.  
9. They only really wanted to talk about the Mental Health symptoms which were within their realm of knowledge. We talked about depression, anxiety, hoarding, OCD, paranoia. All the things I already know about. The question is; why do I have these things when there is no obvious trauma to blame? Didn't seem to want to talk about the thing I came to discuss ; Asperger Syndrome. Is this because they knew nothing about it? Why was I assigned a clinician who knew nothing about the subject at hand?  
10. In one session I was 'forced' into assessing my mood on a scale that I had no understanding of. A scale of 1 to 10 between sad and happy. I explained that I had no comprehension of happiness, but they said ""come on, work with me"". Well I say ""come on, listen to me"".  
11. Consistently declined to copy my GP into communications. My GP was not informed of my test results, nor my diagnosis when it eventually occurred, and was not informed of my referral to the County Asperger Service (still waiting). I thought we were supposed to be Integrated? Now, my GP practice is trying to chase up all of these things, and I'm going to have to resort to self-referring to the Council run Asperger Service. At the moment I'm making do with getting little bits of info from online facebook groups.  
In the end I got the official diagnosis I needed in order to access the services I need to move forward, but I had to exercise great patience.  
I didn't dare complain, because I knew this was the only available route. This person was the gatekeeper to the support I need.  
I am almost into my fifth decade, and I wonder; will I finally get the right help?  
This service needs to be better.  
If a properly qualified and knowledgable specialist is thought too expensive, then how will you maintain the quality?  
Why weren't regular Patient Reported Outcome Measures used to monitor my wellbeing during this farcical assessment process?  
Why was the PALS notice board devoid of any information at all? I would have expected at least some leaflets or posters about how to complain or give feedback.  
Where are the Service User & Carer Experience forms? What happened to the Friends & Family test? I've not once been asked for my feedback on the service. Well you have it now !  
Can I refer the trust to 3 documents, which could be helpful should you wish to bring the service up to a good standard :  
1. The Autism Act 2009  
2. The Green Light Toolkit.  
3. NICE Guidance CG142 & QS51  
If this is the standard of service that Notts Trust is spending it's money on then the CCGs should quite rightly be cutting the funding. In times where money is tight, we must make sure that there is no hiding place for services that just aren't fit for purpose.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",231

"ct","Care received","Therapies","I enjoyed my time in hospital, and particularly remember the Occupational Therapy and Highbury Live departments. I remember being introduced to the allotments and I think it is really good to have a garden space to walk around in. Also, there are multiple opportunities offered there, and I had fun planting chard (which I was told is like spinach, I think)- I actually planted stuff! That is really satisfying. I also enjoyed doing some loosening up of the soil (like ploughing) and raking leaves. Got a very warm welcome from Delia on my first visit, who showed me around the garden. Also, credit goes to Claire, who was very polite, sensitive and kind when I met her in the allotment. I think having the allotment gives the sense that this isn’t just a hospital, but is connected to an allotment community, connected to the outside world (especially as I heard people from the community come and help out). I think Phil’s good work in selling the produce and putting the funds back into the allotment is excellent. The Nature in Mind activities are a good idea, giving days which have a focus on nature, the environment and the allotment. It was nice to scoop out pumpkins and I am sure, though I didn’t do it, the flower arranging was fun for people who did it.  
It’s also really encouraging to inpatients when you know there is someone, in my case, Phil, who is responsible for activities and who you can raise concerns, ideas and requests. And it’s good to have a friendly face around, who you can talk to. It’s good to have someone who regularly visits the ward who is part of the staff team. Phil also was at the Ward community meeting and his presence meant that feedback could be referred to him to see what could be done, and I remember the Ward manager referring to him to see if anything could be put in place, like the possibility of bread making.  
In terms of listening to our views and telling us what’s going on, I think the community meetings run by Highbury Live were excellent, as you can hear the views of other inpatients (to see that you aren’t alone in your views, like the issue with the laundry) and know that someone is actually listening and thinking about your concerns. Also, very positive reception to new ideas I suggested, like social afternoons.  
On the topic of socialising, the social nights were very good (run by Lynsey- apologies if any spelling error!), and a good activity to do. It was really good to see other people in hospital. Sticky thirteens is a good activity (though not too many times, as after about two, it gets boring- maybe other ideas for card games or other games would be good here) and I enjoy the Quiz. Maybe we could diversify activities and enlarge the range offered on social nights. Perhaps we could think of ways to encourage more people to go along to them, though the turnout is already good. I am also aware of the Christmas fayre, pantomime and open Mic night, the latter two of which I will hopefully be going to.  
Other things I can think of are the Highbury Rovers football team, where inpatients can join in, and are joined by people from the community. We play at Harvey Haddon Sports Village- this is very good for exercise, interacting with other people in the context of sport and just something fun to look forward to each month. You get so see and meet new people as well. Also, Phil sometimes gets a group of the male inpatients to play football in the field behind the hospital- this is good fun. Phil also offers arts and crafts, and I did painting on a canvas- also colouring in is offered. Jacob is responsible for the Highbury Library trolley (and I think he looks after the books in the library itself), and brings the trolley round to each of the wards- this is good for encouraging reading and offering books to inpatients. Jacob is also a great guy to talk to- the Highbury Live team are friendly people!  
The idea of having a big screen with projector to show films or the World cup etc. and getting people together to watch it, and providing food is an interesting idea.  
I think also Highbury Live provided activities like Bowls and archery (safe version!) for cherry and silver birch wards. And there was mention of potentially a ‘gemstone therapy’ person coming in- I guess this is using amethysts and rubies to give a therapeutic effect- probably because they are so beautiful, so will have psychological benefit.  
Highbury Live is already very good, and I think there is much potential for continued development. Future developments:  
1 bread making (and even provide this for the ward- home made bread!),  
2 expansion into other sports, like tennis, rounders, croquet…  
3 starting up 'clubs', like chess, scrabble, and many other ideas (search Uni societies for massive lists), and getting groups together.  
4 further integration of the wards (more social connection opportunities),  
5 other activities to be thought of- ideas are endless, waiting to be stumbled upon!  
6 More close partnership with Occupational Therapy, like more joint team meetings, mixing the staff together (eg one from each team together leading an activity),… (I am not sure- this may happen already, in which case, keep going!)  
Thank you to the Highbury Live team for what they have done- a great asset for the hospital, who enhance the lives of the patients. It’s also a great department where volunteers can attach to, like working alongside members of the team. I hope that the future holds many more exciting developments and opportunities!","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",243

"dd","Dignity","Dignity: General","I had such a bad experience with this team. My GP referred me which was great as I got an appointment the next day. I went to the appointment and it was very much a fact find even though I have been accessing mental health services for six years at Highbury and QMC.
I had so much hope for this appointment I desperately needed help after already taking two overdoses. As always the doctor was lovely but the mental health nurse I am sure had been sent by the devil. She agreed to visit me at home but was very judgement and disorganised which lead to her not showing up to my appointment. I sat at home for three hours waiting and the help line stated she was still coming - she never turned up.
I spoke with a team leader who booked for someone in four days which was excessive as I was desperate for help. I am sure on this visit the different nurse meant well but he was a strange man to me and he probed in to emotional, physical and sexual abuse I had been a victim of as a child. I am very guarded about my personal live, I had only just met this man and it crushed me having to talk about this yet  again. I made it quite clear that when he left I was going to OD he managed to magic some so called anchor points from somewhere and left.
I keep my word I felt so low and worthless and traumatised by my experience with the crisis team I took a massive OD, nearly died, was in resus at qmc all night and then finally sectioned the next day.
There is a lovely doctor in the crisis team that used to work in perinatal maybe he could pass on some skills such as time keeping (ok this is crap but he turns up at least) empathy and strength to deal with complex situations.
I really hope that the people who need to read this do, this team deal with contacts that could be life or death and quite frankly the Samaritans are much better.

I am an American living in the UK. To say that I am a "" fish out of water "" would be an understatement. I had no clue as to where to turn to ,to get help for my child with complex disabilities. In truth, I was feeling hopeless, as I watched my daughter struggle. I had heard from other parents that the support for our children were ""a joke"" or "" non existence "". Fortunately, I can honestly say, ""hand on heart"" that in our case ,it was just the opposite. .  
From the first intake session with Zoe,I had actually begun to feel that there was hope. That I was not alone in my quest to get help for my child. Zoe has gone above and beyond to help support and to find extra support for my child. In truth, Zoe has established a positive rapport of trust with my child which, trust me, was no easy feat !!  
Through Zoe, we were able to have access to a psychiatrist for my daughter. Enter Dr. Saha, who is also a wonderful and caring individual. She has also been very supportive for my child and myself. To be honest, Zoe and Dr. Saha, are a "" dynamic duo"". Together they brainstorm and find solutions to further help my child.  
In closing, I just wanted to take a moment to applaud the wonderful work done by them both, with an extra ""shout out"" to the exceptional work done by Zoe , who in all honesty, has and continues to give her all for the sake of my child.

"cs","Care received","Advice and support","Back in 2014 I became pregnant with my daughter after trying for 4 and a half years. I was all excited but at the beginning of December 2014 we found out my mum (my best friend) had got lung cancer. It had gone that far she needed her lung removing. After numerous of appointment she had the horrific operation in February. In between I had to keep telling myself I was pregnant and had to look after myself as well as my mum. She then started chemotherapy wich make her really poorly and most of the time was admitted. After a few months they stopped the chemotherapy and just went to frequent appointments. I could now start sorting myself out.  
After seeing the midwife and having scans I was told I was having a girl which we was all over the moon. We was then took into a room where we was told there was a high chance of my daughter having down syndrome and there was things they could do to find out but there was a chance I could lose her. 8 years ago my mum had the procedure done as she was told the same thing and unfortunately lost my brother. So I wasn’t having none of it. My mum was slowly on the mend and my belly was growing what more could I have wanted. As time went on I was admitted to triage with migraines when I was discharged the hospital gave me a letter to say I was being induced on the two week early.  
I was excited but my mum n dad would be on holiday so wouldn’t be here. But everything mum had been through she needed a holiday. So on I went to hospital and I was induced. I gave birth to my beautiful daughter on the 21st June 2015 (Father’s Day) what more could I have gave her Dad. I started breastfeeding straight away and had a lady called Sarah come and show me what to do. She said she was a breastfeeding peer support worker at my local children centre and there was a group on Wednesday morning called BABES to help mums breastfeeding. Mum n dad can home early as they couldn’t wait any longer.  
A week later the midwife came to see my daughter and I was rushed into hospital straight into theatre I still had placenta inside me. I was discharged 2 days later. At home I was having problems feeding my daughter and my breasts was getting sore and I was getting low in mood. So I said to my partner if he would come to the centre with me on Wednesday to see if I could get some help and advice. As I don’t like going out alone and don’t like meeting new people. So Wednesday came and we went to the group. As soon as I walked through the door I felt so welcomed it was lovely. We was shown around and met the breastfeeding supporters and Sarah was there that I met at the hospital so I felt a little bit more comfortable and she introduced us to Nichola that was also I support worker. They both gave me advise and some information on breastfeeding to take home with me.  
A week later I went back and I was struggling with feeding my daughter but I didn’t was to give up breastfeeding if I didn’t have a problem. We tried different positions and soon got my daughter feeding properly and my breast was soon on the mend. But I was still low in mood I couldn’t stop crying so one Wednesday morning Sarah and the team was amazing and said I should make an appointment to see the doctor. I did and I got Sarah to come with me as I was nervous. So she did and I was diagnosed with postnatal depression and put on medication.  
Since then I still breastfed my daughter till she was 2 and I was loving being a mum. We go to the centre every Wednesday to the group and love it. I love it that much I have done a volunteer course and also completed my breastfeeding peer support training so I am now a volunteer at the centre and can also help other mums in need. And my partner is just about to start it too. I can’t thank the centre enough my confidence had grown I now get out and about and loving being a parent. I also get involved in the centre as much as I can.","2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",256

Three months ago, I had my first child and I want to thank all the people linked to the Stapleford Care Centre, who supported me to breast feed.  
I breast fed my daughter straight after birth and thought I had it sussed, but after five days, I gave her a bottle because my nipples had become so sore. I’d not been using techniques to help my baby latch-on properly, I thought I’d just put her to the nipple and that would be it. Also I doubted that I was producing enough milk for my daughter, as she seemed to be constantly on-and-off the breast. Friends and family tried to be supportive, by telling me that there was ‘nothing wrong with giving a bottle feed’ and encouraged me to give a formula feed before bed, so I could sleep through a good part of the night. The Midwife Team saw my daughter feeding and gave some advice on how to maintain a good feed, but my nipples became so sore and I felt I had to continue to to use a bottle, for fear of my nipples becoming unusable!  
The Midwife Team recommended that I go to BABES Breast Feeding Support Group, Stapleford Care Centre, so when my daughter was two weeks old, I went. I was warmly greeted by the volunteer worker who ran that session and by all the other mums. I soon felt comfortable being around women who had come through what I was going through, to successfully breast feed. The volunteer worker sat with me for most of that BABES session and gave me advice on breast feeding. Learning the techniques to a good latch-on enabled me to continue to breast feed. The techniques are simple, but I needed to be shown and told a few times, before I started to use them all!  
I went to BABES the following week and a BABES staff worker went over the latch-on techniques, but more importantly to me, reassured me that I was producing enough milk for my baby and told me how important the night feeds are, for milk production. With that encouraging talk in my mind, I felt supported enough to stop giving the one or two formula bottles a day, which I had started to give, and from three weeks, my child has been fed exclusively by my breast milk. This wouldn’t have happened without BABES support, as BABES gave me breast feeding knowledge that my friends and family didn’t have.  
BABES are responsible for my breast feeding success and I plan to breast feed my baby for as long as she needs it and wants it. I’m very grateful to BABES and continue to go to the weekly session and Stapleford Care Centre, as it’s nice to be around other breast feeding women and the BABES breast feeding experts.

The Sense of community project has affected me in a negative way. The Sense of Community doesn’t exist on Malvern and the 6 C’s didn’t apply. It has affected my confidence in approaching staff- it is seen as me moaning.  
It has the potential to be of value if individuals can be seen as important, if we can unite as patients and staff it would be good, happy and a busy patient is better for everybody.  
There seems to have been no leadership from staff on the project and no energy from staff. Nursing assistants I came into contact with didn’t want to be involved, they said you had to speak to a qualified but it felt like passing the buck. There was lack of materials with few resources. The pictures for the Northern Lights project didn’t get done as there is no activities co-ordinator due to the problems experienced. There is no point of contact. I am willing to be involved but it seems that no-one wants to be involved, it seems like an inconvenience to the staff.  
The positives of the project are that I’m still alive and I’ve managed to get through a difficult time. The feeling of a ‘them and us’ attitude is not conducive to my mental health. We’ve had no Christmas celebrations, no prizes or gifts so the Christmas spirit was lacking. The decorations didn’t come until too late.  
A senior member of staff said to put energy and resources into individuals if others don’t want to be involved. When activities are cancelled we need some activities on the ward to stop boredom which leads to bad behaviour.  
I am only on a small income so cannot afford craft things for myself. A positive thing was the making of the 3D Christmas cards. It would be nice to have management attend the community meetings- do they sit down with individual patients to give individual care needs? There are no OT’s on the ward, it’s a struggle to get activities to reduce self-harm.","2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",258

"ds","Dignity","Feeling safe including bullying","Malvern ward  
The Sense of community project hasn’t been directed at the individual diagnoses on the ward. I felt that big personality’s tried to rule the roost and patients with smaller personalities tended to get overlooked or misunderstood and their ideas invalidated.  
The effect is then negative for the latter group. They have skills that are not being recognized, used, valued or validated. I have valued my independence and being strong minded against ‘invasive forces’- these are not necessarily a person but could be something you want, something you fear or anything wanted or not wanted.  
There have been challenged for the Sense of Community project which have included bullying, time constraints, materials and goods not arriving on time, changes in routine, having to deal and communicate with more people that I am used to dealing with. Also, it has been a challenge having privacy and a safe environment in which to express those ideas that are mine. I wouldn’t say there have been any positive changes on my ward since doing the project. I felt it provided the big personalities with more ‘power’. People of different types of personality were polarised.  
If we were to do a future project can we have more places to order supplies from? And can we have better staffing or protected time on the ward, regardless of what’s going on, so it can happen?  
Can we have information presented clearer for different people e.g autism or learning disability friendly?","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",264

On Stage 2 I lost the passion with the project falling flat down so soon afterwards with no time to order the equipment that we needed. I valued being involved as I have had my art displayed in the courtyard that will hopefully stay displayed for a long time after I have left Rampton (which is soon). I wasn’t able to get motivated for Stage 2 but I hope Stage 3 will get better service from all.  
Challenges have included money, equipment, time, interpersonal clashes and negativity from some staff and patients. At Stage 1 I was able overcome this but I wasn’t able to get past money or equipment issues at Stage 2.  
The real positive changes from the project are being able to have real fish that are alive and swimming well and that for a small time it united a ward of 10 males working closely together.

"cr","Care received","Rules/approach to care","My opinion about my stay on B2 ward is that there is not enough done to understand the psychology of the patient.  
It has taken until this year for my mind to clear enough to remember the delusions I had whilst on B2.  
The medical report says very little about my mental condition, just external behaviour.  
The delusions stayed with me even when I had left B2, but no real observations were made by people supposed to be trained in mental health.  
Medication may play a part in mental health, but there should be more focus on psychology and counselling to understand the patient's story and help them find ways of coping better, perhaps we would see fewer suicides then, as people on medication often feel trapped and hopeless in their condition.  
Whilst on B2 the staff disregarded my wife's input and would not communicate with her, they were rude and ignorant to her.  
If they had communicated properly with her they would have gained insight into my mental health, this may have reduced the amount of time spent on the ward and freed up a bed, which are in such short supply.  
I hold the nurse given responsibility for me wholly to blame.  
If they had checked case history and communicated properly with my wife/carer they would have gained insight into how I present normally and have been more able to care for me appropriately.  
Their disrespect for my wife and to her was uncalled for and they still owe her an apology for the disrespect.  
Presenting as over familiar is mentioned in the medical report, it is totally out of character for me, again this kind of thing really ought to be discussed with immediate family and carers, else you are treating someone whilst being blindfolded.  
We (my wife and I ) had received testimony that B2 were bad for communicating with patient's family and carers, we now know for ourselves how that feels.  
Also we had been advised not to use PALS by another friend but we tried, just to get fobbed off with excuses. Twice we have used PALS to no avail. We find the system inadequate to the real needs of the patient and the system for complaints to be a total disappointment for them too.  
Our trust in the NHS is greatly diminished for my safety and welfare, which would take too long to go into now.  
My wife and I have struggled through the last 2 and a half years not knowing who to trust anymore, because B2 and the rest of the system let us down.  
I really do believe the methods for assessing mental health need to be examined and more thorough questions need to be asked of the patient to be able to discern or perceive properly the patient's state of mind.  
Medication may calm them down, but doesn't get to the deeper rooted problems of thoughts and emotions which all contribute.  
I hope to hear of changes within the mental health sector.","-2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",318

"tc","Transition/coordination","Consistency/Continuity of care","My father was under the care of Sarah P. a Community Matron for the last 5 years of his life. He described her as 'The Miracle Woman'. She visited dad at least once a week, spending time listening to how he was feeling and stepping in to help when he needed medical attention. She knew Dad, and she could see as soon as she walked in whether he was his normal self, or if there was a problem. She became a great support and friend to us as a family. If we had any concerns about Dad we knew we just had to call Sarah and she would be there to help. She was able to recognise infections etc early and ensure that Dad got prompt treatment, this prevented much suffering for him and also negated the need for a hospital admission.

"cr","Care received","Rules/approach to care","I have been a perinatal befriender for over 12 months now and I am so proud that I have been part of a programme that supported a new mum who really needed a friend and someone to help her see there was a future with her baby.  
The training was excellent and allowed me to ask those questions that I was uncertain about considering I do not work within this area. I was nervous and anxious about meeting my new mum when we got matched, but it felt so natural straight away and we quickly developed a friendship. I put this down to the staff at Rushcliffe who paired us as it is so important that you can get along.  
The staff within Rushcliffe were so supportive and always available for me to speak to after every visit and express any concerns I had. This was a huge factor and meant I handed over any worries rather than them consuming me between my visits. As a volunteer you are made to feel part of the team which surprised me but also made me appreciate all the hard work the centre does.  
The new mother I was paired with was experiencing some issues and each week I never quite knew what to expect but I do feel my weekly visits did help and fundamentally I had the time to chat to her and point out how far she had come, even on those days she could not see that. It didn't take long for her to open up to me (more than I believe she would have done to the Family Support workers) and I feel this is so important with this service, especially when a new mother is struggling with mental health issues on top of becoming a new parent which is life changing anyway.  
My time when we met up was more about giving her emotional support rather than practical as this is what she needed. I remember one day her feeling extremely low and vulnerable so I gave her a break down of her day and what she needed to do and returning the following week she told me she had done what I had told her to do and how it had helped. I felt so pleased that I had focussed her and helped when she was feeling so low. Each week was so different and she would have a new worry but together we could focus and get through issues, such as the thought of returning to work, which eventually she did.  
I have finished supporting my mum now and looking back on the journey we have been on it is incredible and I feel very proud of her and how far she has come. I know she had a lot of support but I strongly feel that this service really did help her and gave her some continuity in her quest to improve her life as a new mother.  
For the family support team to be able to offer this service it is so important as I was lucky I had friends and family to support me when I had my children but there are so many who are alone and this service provides that extra support needed.  
Please keep up with good work Rushcliffe!

So as a result of unpleasant side effects I choose not to take metaformin, but I then get written up as refusing to comply with medication regime.  
At the same time the nurses don't care and leave me at risk due to this. Diabetes UK advised me to take food with my meds.  
It's draconian. I very rarely eat breakfast at that time in the morning so when I ask can I have my medication and breakfast a bit later I am told no, it frustrates me that staff can have their breakfast at any time. It's divide and conquer as nurses can do what they want but patients can't.

"cc","Care received","Care received","After my fantastic Psychiatrist let the trustI have only seen a Psychiatrist twice in nearly 2 years, both of whom were locums and left quite quickly.  
Having already complained about the service I was receiving I found myself again in a position where I was telling healthcare professionals that I was not coping. I have no lead clinician that I am aware of or a Care Coordinator and I do not know what the plan for my care is, things that I believe I should be aware of.  
No one at Manor Road has taken responsibility and when I complain I get excuses but no action. I made the decision to ask that I be transferred to another team, one with a full time Psychiatrist so I can consistently see the same person with whom I can build a relationship of trust, something that I feel is very important when divulging private information. You would think that this would be easy, I got in touch with PALS and I gave my reasons and explained that I wanted no further contact with Manor Road. I got a very curt response from a member of staff telling me that I needed to contact Manor Road to ask for this to happen.  
So I did ring Manor Road, I was very stressed and upset and felt that both myself and the member of staff I spoke to were put in a very difficult position. I was shocked further to be told that there was every chance that my request would go back to the person who had responded to my request to change teams (and told me to contact manor road).  
I believe that my mental health has suffered because my treatment. As a person with a long term mental health condition I put my trust in the professionals but because I have a mental health problem I can be taken advantage of quite easily. However if you do try to stand up for yourself and demand better care you are met with resistance and excuses and you have very little recourse.  
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust need to remember that there business is people and often vulnerable people and when they get a complaint or request they should respond in a kind and non threatening manner. I would advise anyone who has had a similar experience to me or who feel that there individual needs are not being met to stand up and be counted. Surely gone are the times when as a mental health patient you are told you 'get what you get, like it or lump it'","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",408
"cp","Care received","Physical care","I recently went into hospital for a prostatectomy operation. I was admitted Monday morning and after the op, was taken to the recovery ward and then to the urology ward. I had surgical stockings, a catheter and six incisions in my abdominal area, one of which was dressed due to post-op bleeding. I had an allocated nurse when I arrived on the ward.  
The nurses on the ward change every 12 hours and so her shift finished at 7pm and a new team started and I had another nurse allocated. At 7am the next morning the day shift started again with a different set of nurses. One of my other wounds started bleeding so I called for a nurse to have a dressing applied. This she said she would do and duly came back with the dressing.  
My nominated nurse then came along and showed me how to change my catheter bag which was strapped to my leg and with which I would be going home with. She said that I had to change which leg I had the bag fixed to each day in order to avoid ""penis rot"" which was quite alarming to hear.  
I was then told that I could go home at 3.30pm that same day. In the meantime another wound had started to weep and I again called for a nurse to apply a dressing. This was done. When I was due to leave the ward I asked if I could have some spare dressings to take home with me. My nominated nurse said that I had to request them from the district nurse when I got home and that if I had any problems with my catheter I had to do the same and contact the district nurse.  
As I was leaving I wanted to ask my nominated nurse how long I had to wear the surgical stockings for. She was on a break so I asked one of the other staff nurses and she said that, as I was self injecting myself for 28 days with a blood thinner I only needed the stockings for a few days until I was mobile. I thought that this didn't sound right so I decided myself that I would wear them at least until my catheter was removed. The day after I got home my penis was quite sore and burning so I phoned the number given to me for the district nurse team.  
However, I actually got through to the emergency urology advise team and when I explained the situation I was told it was probably ""penis rot"" and to contact the district nurse team on the number he gave me on the phone. I duly contacted the team and asked if they could call and check my catheter and also could they bring some dressings as the ones I had needed changing and another was weeping and I only had simple plasters at home.  
I was told that they do not supply dressings as they only dealt with catheters and I had to go and see my GPs practice nurse for fresh dressings. At this point I was practically housebound due to mobility problems and had no way of getting to my GPs.  
The district nurse came out and said that my catheter had not been positioned properly on the ward and was pulling when I sat down causing the pain and burning sensation. He adjusted it and gave me an anaesthetic gel to use. When I mentioned the ""penis rot"" and having to change the position of the bag to alternate legs each day he said that was rubbish as ""penis rot"" only happened occasionally in men with long term catheters i.e. for months and changing the position each day would probably cause more harm than good.  
I went back to the urology ward a week later to have my catheter removed in a TWOC. This was quite painful and bled quite a lot. The nurse said that was usual and that I should drink extra water to dilute it out. I satisfactorily passed urine on the 3 occasions I needed to in order to go home and not have the catheter back in. I mentioned to the nurse about my wounds and dressings (at this point I only had plasters on). She said these were no good as they didn't breathe so she changed all the dressings and gave me some spare to take home. I also asked if I could take off my surgical stockings as I had my catheter out and was told that I had to wear them for at least a month.  
Throughout all this time I felt confused and frustrated with so many conflicting views.  
The op I had is pretty standard and I felt that, to save any confusion and to help the ward nurses who are extremely busy anyway, it may be a good idea to have a standard check list that clearly outlines what the procedure is for catheters/stockings/dressings etc and to have clear telephone numbers and information about where to go for after ward care.  
The ward had drawer fulls of dressings so why not send the patient home with spares? Why can't the district nurse team deal with dressings or other things apart from just catheters? Why isn't there a standard time on surgical stocking wear? and why aren't the people on the urology ward and emergency telephone line aware that ""penis rot"" is very occasional and only in long term catheter wearers and not for men like me who only had the catheter for 8 days? Also urology ward nurses in particular should know how to correctly position catheter bags and be able to give the correct advice on maintenance upon going home.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",409

I would like to say a massive thank you to the Dementia Outreach Team, not wanting to make anyone feel embarrassed but the support we are given from the service without you i would not be able to do my job, My Home is fully supported above and beyond to help residents live the best life they can, Person Centered care is their number 1 priority.  
Debbie- who has worked tirelessly with the home to ensure a service user had the best quality of life, even when it seemed impossible Debbie helped the team over come the obstacles. Mike- when Mike talks i write everything he says so i can use it at a later date to make myself look good and the care plans all have mikes words of wisdom in them. Sharon, Helen C, Helen S, Erin, Lesley -( who is the now part timer but we feel should still be included ) Karen who like Debbie works with us to overcome obstacles, Dawn-who has a lovely calm approach and the documentation is spotless , Beckie and Hannah-and Kimberly who we now keep a spare pen and trousers for in the office in-case they rip( sorry ) but we know they are ripped because you was working hard with your moving and handling techniques.  
Ellen- who works so hard giving the residents time and friendship and creating amazing life history books.  
i am sorry but i have forgot the lady who worked with Mike for a service user who had very extreme and advanced Dementia, we tried numerous ways to help this service user to feel safe and it was the most distressing dementia that we have ever witnessed. This lady offered a weighted blanket for certain care interventions and the service user's distress was reduced, it was an emotional moment and one that will never be forgotten something that cost as little as 50 pound made the biggest difference to someones life, the lady didn't even take it back with her we were allowed to borrow it until ours was ordered and delivered.  
Thank you doesn't seem enough and for those who i haven't mentioned i am sorry.  
we are truly great full for all the help and support you give our home daily.

"ti","Transition/coordination","Coordination/Integration Of Care","I want to say a huge thank you to the midwifery and perinatal psychiatry team at the QMC for their fantastic care throughout my pregnancy and beyond.  
I have suffered with mental health issues my entire life and when I mentioned this on my first midwife appointment, I was referred through to the psychiatry team at the QMC. Michelle (I think her name was, the hospital took my maternity notes and my memory is awful) was absolutely fantastic. She made sure she saw me on a regular basis, helped me make sense of my anxieties and emotions. At times when I felt like my feelings were trivial, she made me realise they were completely normal and justified and gave me invaluable advice which led to the healthy birth of my first daughter. She also spoke to my partner on many occasions and kept him in check- which I adore her for! When I gave birth she made sure she was the one who came to visit me at home which was beyond her care of duty but helped give my pregnancy journey closure. I cannot thank her enough and I smile thinking of the times I cried in her office and all the advice she gave me which has led me to do a complete you-turn on my whole way of life. I am completely a different person now (for the greater good I believe) and have her to thank for this.  
Cisi and Dr Hofberg have helped me through my pregnancy journey and beyond and have given me some of the best health care I have experienced. They are the first health professionals who I have felt have truly listened and understood me, are still continuing to help me be the most stable version of myself and have never given up in helping me with issues that in comparison to some others I would imagine are quite trivial in parts.  
I cannot thank Dr Hofberg enough for her continued support and referrals to help me find some answers to a previous adhd diaognosis. I have lived with the condition all my life with no proper support or treatment, however I now feel confident that with her help I may finally get the answers I am so desperately searching for. I am so grateful our paths have crossed.

"cm","Care received","Medication ","I use the Stonebridge Centre to access my mental health services in Nottingham. This might be called Nottingham Central or Nottingham East, but I'm not sure.  
I wonder if our Trust could have a coming off anti-depressants service, and indeed coming off other medications that psychiatrists ask our gps to prescribe for us?  
I am having a dire time coming off Seroxat and have been trying for ages to come off by reducing the doses etc bit by bit. I have had to find out all by myself how to do it, and as my bad luck would have it, what on earth all the physical feelings, and a host of other things I'm experiencing are all about and how to deal with them. I would so value some help, and indeed someone assigned to me as a touch base, back up, and support when needed, person to help me through. It's a very lonely thing to tackle on my own.  
In my case there is no medical imperative to come off. I just would like to have a go at the anti-depressant free life, as I've been on anti-depressants since 1979 except for about 4 years within that time and feel I'd like to see if what I've learned about myself and the strategies I've learned to enable me to have a better quality of life can work for me. I won't know this, unless I come off anti-depressants. I never knew though how dire coming off would be!!  
I realise that the Stonebridge Centre can't even offer a basic service for us to see a psychiatrist at the moment as the Locum Services aren't even available just now. So that might be a factor for me. I haven't seen a psychiatrist since the beginning of June 2017. But even if I had, I don't think there's a coming off service that I could have been referred to. So if the Trust could have one, it would benefit a lot of people. I know a couple of people struggling with coming off, who do have a medical imperative to come off Lithium, as its long-term use has seriously damaged either their kidneys or liver, sorry can't remember which! So it would help more than anti-depressant withdrawal.  
Perhaps the Nottingham Mental Health Services could think about this for us.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",437

"ti","Transition/coordination","Coordination/Integration Of Care","My partner and I had gone through IVF for 5 years and have been through a very tough time since our children were born. It has been such an emotional roller coaster for us through our struggle to have a baby with IVF being our only option.  
Nurture Fertility helped us along the journey in 2013 and in early 2015 I became pregnant but unfortunately had a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks pregnant. My partner and I needed some time to come to terms with what had happened and weren’t ready to try again until the following year.  
In preparation I also had a massive change to my diet. Although I was already within the criteria, but lost 3stone 2lb prior to treatment to try and maximise every chance. This time we had 2 embryos put back, which was our last two and our last chance. We were absolutely shocked and over the moon to find out that they were expecting twins!  
Early last year we went for a routine scan and I was told that I would need to be monitored for 24 hours (my due date was 2 months away, I didn't end up leaving the hospital from that point). Less than 2 weeks later our babies were born by emergency c section at just 29.5 weeks old due to preeclampsia. Both children were transferred from Nottingham City Hospital to the Royal Stoke Hospital due to capacity issues, miles away from where we lived. I almost died during the c-section and required two blood transfusions, one on the Thursday and another early hours Sunday morning. I was unable to meet my babies for almost a week and had to be transferred via ambulance. This was unbearable after we had waited so long for our dream.  
Both our children spent 5 days in high dependency and 16 days in special care before being transferred back to Nottingham NICU after 3 weeks.  
Baby L weighed 1560 grams (3lb 4oz) when they were born and was finally well enough to come home.  
Little A had a few problems along their journey and had an infection at birth and managed to pick up a few infections along the way. Our baby also contracted e-coli, which the hospital felt to be contaminant from the throat, and also had an upper respiratory tract infection. A has Respiratory distress syndrome, and was diagnosed with chronic lung disease at just 36 weeks old (gestation), hence the reason for a 24 hour oxygen requirement.  
A also has an artery that didn't close up at birth, along with a heart murmur and while this can be quite common in children, some do indicate serious problems, so this is still a worry. These issues are getting better as A is getting bigger and stronger.  
A was born at just 1280 grams (2lb 8oz) and finally came home to join the rest of the rest of the family the following month.  
While I was in hospital my state of mind wasn’t at its best as I was so scared and worried about taking the boys home and having very little support from family and friends being at work etc. I didn’t know what to expect as a mum.  
Tracy used to be around NICU on a Wednesday and provided support, guidance and a friendly face (also a shoulder to cry on, on a few occasions). I used to look forward to the coffee morning as it got you away from the ward and to talk to other parents in the same situation. It was kind of nice to do something normal for an hour.  
I was advised about little senses while on the ward but could only attend when A's health improved. It’s such a lovely group with structure and is very meaningful. The centre itself is also very informative with the posters providing guidance and advice.  
Tracy also advised me about the sensory room at Chilwell, which I visit regularly, they are also very helpful and help me with the twins in and out of the car.  
I got to a very, very low point and had a breakdown after one of the little senses groups. I explained to the girls that I felt useless and didn’t know what to do regarding feeding the boys and getting them to put weight on. This was a big issue for me and I was also becoming very isolated and recluse as my moods were very low. I felt like I couldn’t cope and everything was a challenge. I ended up having to send the boys to a childminder for 10 hours per week and doing a self-referral for family support.  
I was so pleased I ended up with Tracy, I felt like she understood me and didn’t judge me and I could be open and honest with her to get the support I needed. We have spoken about a lot to try and get me back on track and out of the house and I have also been visiting the doctors on a regular basis. I am receiving treatment for my depression and was also due back at work in November but A hasn't been well enough as well as myself.  
I do have to force myself to get out and have not been particularly great with my moods recently. I have had to ask if we can leave, if we have been in certain places as I get into a panic and get upset at the thought of people looking at me and judging me. Tracy calms me down and we talk about what happened, why I felt the way I did and how I can try to overcome it.  
I feel so proud when I manage to go out and try and feel the boys but sometimes I just can’t do it. I was crying in the high street, after trying to feed the boys in Tesco a while ago and luckily bumped into A’s respiratory nurse, who calmed me down and walked me to my car to get me home. Things like this make me feel like a failure.  
Without Tracy to support and guide me I think I would have fallen to pieces by now. I have learnt so much from her and feel so privileged to be receiving the care and support I do from her. She is an absolute asset to Sure Start and I don’t think I could have wished for a more caring and supportive person.  
My husband is soon to be working away so Tracy helped me with a referral to Home Start for some additional support, which was brilliant.  
I'm 100% confident that I wouldn’t have got to where I am now and it makes me feel sad at the thought of the day she will no longer be our family support worker. I value her being in our lives and cannot actually express how much of a difference she is making.  
Both boys are doing OK and haven’t been admitted to hospital for 7 weeks! L now weighs 21lb 6oz and A is 19lb 8 and is almost off his oxygen.  
Sure Start are supportive through every aspect and Tracy is making the journey so much more bearable, I can’t thank her enough and will NEVER EVER FORGET how she has made me the mum I am to date.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",444

"co","Care received","1-2-1 care/Time spent with service user","Unfortunately I suffer from a complex and chronic serious mental health condition. It is unfortunate because over the last 9 years I have on several occasions been in crisis and needed more intensive/daily support than my cpn can provide and therefore been referred to City Crisis team.  
This box isn't big enough for me to detail the amount of times they have let me down, put my life in serious risk and made me definitely more unstable than I was on refferal to them. But it is more than a dozen.  
Firstly, they fail to provide you with any therapeutic contact. You are lucky if their flying visits last longer than 10 mins and always consist of ' have you eaten? did you sleep? any suicidal plans? ' which in itself are redundant questions as no matter your response it will be met with ' ok well I'll go but ring us if you need us'.  
For legitimate personal reasons I requested on many occasions over the last few years to only have female staff visit me. Which shouldn't be hard considering the team has more female workers. They failed to follow my request and after speaking to their service manager in January I was assured this was a red flag that would be followed. On referral to them at Easter they sent a male every time, which felt to me like a deliberate attempt to push me over the edge.  
Basically experience has told me that I cannot trust or rely on them. They tell me they will visit and show up hours later without any explanation and often don't show up at all. I don't get an apology either. This is the crisis team and there is no accountability!. Not to me, my doctor, my regular care team or my family.  
As example, on Easter Sunday I waited by the door in plain view of my house for 2.5 hours to be told a) I had failed to spot them b) my bell had failed to ring c) my dog failed to bark and d) my smart phone despite being on had failed to log the missed call they CLAIM to have made and the team had now all gone home. I was reluctant to work with them after but despite being emergency in their ranking they then took the opportunity to discharge me without consulting my care team and in my cpn absence.  
Telephone calls they promise never materialise either so don't hang on for a call.  
After screwing you over for week or so they will then either discharge you probably when you are even more in crisis or wash their hands and find you a bed in a hospital anyway.  
It's such a shame as there are a few good nurses and workers there but only a few in a large team of rather uncaring and incompetent workers. Their doctors are good particularly Dr DiMambro but it will take more than a few good and well meaning workers to change the mess and long standing issues at play. Until then I feel crisis care in nottingham city is pretty much redundant and I speak to a lot of patients who share my views and experiences.  
Please sort yourself out as these are vulnerable times and lives you are risking!. As for me you have the ultimate get out clause, Having given you over 20 chances to get it right, no more. It says something that I feel that would rather be dead or be sectioned than be referrred your way!!","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",452

We first contacted Sure Start because we felt out of our depth with our sons behavior and sleep routine, but with a couple of visits from Lynn this had all changed. Lynn supplied me with sleep charts and some great tips for keeping our son in his own room all night which was a huge success. Without Lynn's promise of a return visit I don't think we would have had the willpower to follow it through, but we did.  
It has since meant that both our children are in bed at a reasonable time, giving us both time to wind down and relax, and also our own bed back at night.  
The support for my sons behavior has too been incredible, I have learned ways to deal with his anger and tantrums, without getting myself angry or too upset. My son has also come to understand that he can't get his own way.  
The support from Sure Start has also meant that my son and I can now enjoy a better relationship. I actually feel like he now loves me and we can understand each other more knowing what we both need and expect from each other.

"ap","Access","Provision of services","I moved to Nottingham in November 2017. I immediately asked my GP to refer me to the CMHT and to a psychiatrist as I was not able to cope with everyday life because of ADHD and severe depression and I was dissatisfied with my medication.
I was given an appointment with a psychiatrist in June. I had already been treated by psychiatric services in my last place of residence, which should have allowed me to get an appointment faster, but I did not know this as the time.
I was hoping to focus on my treatment and get myself fit for work again, but I could not find any appropriate support. My partner became burnt out as he is my carer and has a very demanding full time job and we were both distressed by my inability to get treatment.
This situation caused me to become extremely suicidal and my GP referred me to the crisis team.
I don't have any complaints about the crisis team, they did listen to me and seem to have done all they could. They managed to get my appointment with the psychiatrist pushed forward.
Despite knowing about my meeting with the crisis team, the doctor did not make any inquiry about my circumstances and only talked about my medication. To his credit he did agree to prescribe me the unusual antidepressant I wanted to try after doing my own research. My GP recommended me to ask for a melatonin prescription for insomnia, but he refused to give me one.
My new antidepressant can cause seizures if the 2 doses a day are taken less than 8 hours apart. He did not tell me this.
I was hoping I might get referred to the ADHD team so I could get advice about where to find a specialised therapist. I was also hoping I might be able to get a bit of support from a nurse or a social worker to take some of the burden off my partner. Even some tips about how to access that kind of care privately at a reasonable price would have been welcome.
The doctor tried to get me to leave immediately after we were done talking about my medication. When I explained the above and highlighted my state of distress and heavy suicidal ideation, as well as my partner's exhaustion and hopelessness, he shrugged and told me that ""The NHS is not perfect"". He refused to refer me to the ADHD team, saying they only did assessments and would not help me. I don't know if I was ever referred to the CMHT. I wasn't given a follow up appointment to check if my medication was okay and if my state had improved.
Fortunately my new treatment does work. I managed to find a private therapist who is able to help me through the ADHD Facebook support group.
I am thankful for those things, but if I hadn't managed to research appropriate medication myself or if it didn't work, and if I hadn't lucked out on finally finding an ADHD therapist after months of fruitless research, I do think I would have committed suicide. At this point I am scared to ask for help from public mental health services again.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",480

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","I would like to share my experience with you because being assessed at Stonebridge Centre Nottingham left me more confused and overwhelmed than I could imagine.  
My story is that I have been struggling with anxiety, depression, binge eating and spells of purging since I was 13 years old. I have been treated for depression and anxiety and sought help for my eating problems since 2014. Before my assessment day at the Stonebridge Centre, I had already completed 20 CBT sessions for my depression/anxiety (primary care), 12 CBT sessions for my binge eating disorder with EDISS (Eating disorders in Student Services by First Steps) and was already on 30mg Citalopram and 10mg Phenergan. My GP was aware of my long-term problem with eating disorder and anxiety; therefore, she referred me to the secondary mental health care at Stonebridge. The day of my assessment, a member of staff greeted me and guided me into a room and started asking questions about my past and my story. I shared as much as I could regarding my past on anxiety, depression and eating problems. It is important to mention that this member of staff did not give me any standardised questionnaire to measure any of my symptoms, it was just a casual chat. At the end I was told that they cannot offer me any help because I have “disordered eating”, but not an eating disorder (please note that I wasn't asked anything about the quantity, intensity and frequency of my eating problem). I was utterly confused and asked what was meant by “disordered eating”. I was told that that I do not have an eating disorder because I am aware of using food to cope with negative emotions. However, later that day, I had a session with my EDISS therapist at that time, and was assured that people who suffer from eating disorders use food (or lack of food) to cope with negative feelings and I fall into this category. Basically, the assessor was wrong. In addition, when I asked the assessor what the difference between a person with an eating disorder and disordered eating is, I was told that we were running out of time and refused to elaborate on my question. I felt totally confused, awkward and let down. The assessor also told me to use self-help to deal with my eating problem and did not suggest any further support. On the other hand, my EDISS therapist assured me later that self-help is what people do before even trying having CBT, which I already had. Overall, I felt that they did not take my mental health problem seriously and were too quick to dismiss me without even offering any alternative support. I felt let down and disappointed by that service and felt they did not care at all.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",513

Although my boys where shy when they first enter the room they soon came round when it was time to get the bubbles out each week and they both joined in with some of the words from the song tiny Tim. They also act out the sessions at home with their dad and big sister getting them all to sit in a circle and do whats in the tin which they sing all the time and the hello song. The session did end up being just myself, grandma and the boys due to the other people not turning up after the first session, we didn't mind this because it meant that we got the staff's full attention on a one to one basis which has helped the boys lots as they have now started to say more words. one of the staff members also gave me information on up and coming events and courses that are going to be happening soon in the centre.","2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",521

I have attended 123 Magic at the Hallcroft centre which I thought was very good and I made new friends and learnt how to use different resources.  
Whilst receiving family support I recognised that some of my issues were because of my worries around debt and finances. Tracey helped me realise which were my priority debts and also helped me to put together a budget plan. I feel relieved to have this plan in place and I have managed to pay off some of my debts as well as setting up direct debits for my bills and other arrears.

"ap","Access","Provision of services","Some of our friends who had a baby 6 months before us had a visit from the health visitor whilst pregnant. I asked my midwife about this who wasn't sure but knew they were going through some changes.  
I never had an antenatal visit from the health visitor at all. When my son was born the midwives handed over my care to the health visitors. They came out and did the usual reviews and mentioned about the antenatal appointment, when I said I hadn't had one they apologised and didn't know why I hadn't.  
Going forward I had some difficulties with my sons weight and other things but never felt I got the support from my health visitor, and although we were supposedly supposed to be being monitored they never chased us up to see us. My son is now 11 and half months, I have heard mums talking abut their children's reviews and how they had letters through the post. I however have never had a letter about a review for my son.  
I decided to check his red book which there is a section about an 8-12 month review, but at 11 and half months we haven't had. So being a diligent mum rang up to find out about this and yes he should bee reviewed and yes we should have received and letter. I feel let down by the service as if I hadn't been on the ball then my son would be missed and what if his development was behind and input required when would this have been picked up, when at school?  
I have also suffered postnatal depression. My doctor said she was contacting the health visitors to support as this is something they can help with. I again received no support.

She said “because people are different”, I was not satisfied with her answer.  
I’m glad I came to Wathwood and not Arnold Lodge, I was assessed for both units but I chose Wathwood. Since I came here I find it is a really good hospital, they focus on getting patients out.

I feel I have a clear treatment pathway which will lead to my release; which I’ve never had before. This is very important to me; I was in Rampton for many years, at some points I didn’t know when I would progress through the hospital.

Feel very frustrated as access to the court yard for fresh air is a coping strategy as I like to walk rather than having to use PRN. However when some staff are on they seem to prefer to spend time in the office than with the patients. I feel like a hamster without a wheel. They claim to support/promote healthy lifestyles but they I feel like they prefer it when we are sat watching t. v. or lying in our beds as that means they are free to do what they want and not what we want.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",556

"cr","Care received","Rules/approach to care","During a local Early Years forum meeting, Louise, a member of the Surestart team, talked about how they were offering a series of free Forest School sessions to local groups, schools and charities (playgroups etc). Having a class who loved the outdoors I approached Louise to see if this could be offered to our Foundation 2 class in a small village school.  
After several emails with Louise we organised a meeting to put into place our 4 sessions, she wanted to see our outdoor area and plan around the space we had available. She produced packs for the parents of the children to sign for risk assessment etc and within a few weeks we were set up and ready to go. The process from my point of view was extremely efficient.  
The session were run by Louise, Sapphire and Kelly - all who demonstrated a passion for working with young children and in particular the outdoors. They weren't phased by the limit outdoor space (and lack of a forest!) planning and delivering activities that all our children thoroughly enjoyed. Especially our children who have significant needs, being driven by the children's interests and working with staff members from our school to insure the children took away a love of the outdoors. The team provided all the resources and I am sure we hit every aspect of the EYFS over the 4 weeks. We did an array of activities from natural paintbrushes, whittling and muddy footprint making!  
After two sessions where we were hit with all four seasons of the British weather we knew as a school it was something we wanted to carry on when the Surestart team left us. The children were truly engaged and produced some fantastic work during and after the sessions.  
We are lucky enough to have the Surestart team running fortnightly session in our school hall so the children were eager to show Kelly and Louise our display of their work, photographs and new ideas for forest school sessions.  
We absolutely loved our sessions and we cannot thank Louise and the team for introducing us to such a fantastic way to engage all children, regardless of needs. Thanks to their support and ideas we will now be continuing our Forest School sessions and hope that others can benefit from the opportunity to have Forest school sessions in their setting.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",562

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","About a year ago after a conversation with my parents, I went to my GP and asked about the possibility that I was in some way autistic, after realising I have many of the symptoms of Aspergers. I was told there was no service for autistic adults in Nottingham- but was then referred to the Aspergers Service at Highbury Hospital. I had to wait until September to be seen (which I was okay with) and when I went a lady collected some information and then told me the wait for m assessment would be six months. I was stunned at the wait but there was little I could do about it so I said nothing.  
I was formally diagnosed with Aspergers in Feburary (after a suicide attempt triggered the crisis team to speak to the Aspergers Service) and handed a booklet which I was told would help me to understand the condition better. I was also advised not to read up too much about the condition on the internet because 'there is a lot of crap out there'. I was then told I would be invited to a series of workshops where I would meet newly diagnosed individuals and gain somee coping strategies. Both myself and my parents were led to believe that the workshops would happen within a few weeks.  
They did not. I was told I would not be seen till June and when I expressed frustration with that, I was then told it would be April, although they thought it was best if I was left to 'sit with' my condition for a while. The booklet I was handed turned out to be more for people who suspected they had Aspergers rather than for those who were recently diagnosed. And the workshops turned out to be just the one. I was sat in a stuffy room for two hours and talked at and down to by staff who were supposed to be supportive. I was handed a bunch of papers and told that this was everything I needed to know and that I would recieve no further help from the Aspergers Service.  
I have trouble with my short term memory and I have trouble taking in information. Being handed a booklet and some papers and being subjected to two hours of a barrage of information has not helped in the slightest. I am still nonplussed about my condition and I still don't have any coping strategies. I know that the Aspergers Team is swamped, but that doesn't excuse the fact that I have been handed this diagnosis, given the bare minimum of assistance and then cut loose. I am not happy.  
Being told you have a condition and then simply given bits of paper is not good enough. I expected support- not a two hour lecture in a stuffy, hot room. How does that help anybody? There needs to be something else, something more... anything other than the treatment (or lack of) I recieved.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",586

I first started coming to baby group it gave me a reason to get out of the house after rough nights of constant feeds, I was always greeted by a friendly smile and reassuring words. It gave me ideas of activities and toys we could do at home. We have been to Babes groups which is a lovely relaxed group. When M was 10 weeks old we did Baby Massage followed by Baby Yoga - Both these sessions gave me confidence, bonding time with M and the opportunity to meet other mum's. At Christmas after a few weeks of thought I decided to come right out of my comfort zone and went to Chatsworth. I went with my friend who I met at Antenatal Class then Baby Yoga. We had the best day, made such special memories that I will treasure forever. In January we started Tiny Talkers, I wanted to do a group where we could do signing, we did this at Woodhouse. It was so much fun, we still practice the songs at home. I would love a follow on session for over 1's. We've done a Mini Kicks session, Baby Bop and the trip to Ferry Farm. I am so grateful to Sure Start for giving M the best foundations. We've learnt so many lovely songs.

Whilst i understand the reason that changes are being made throughout the whole centre, I am extremely disappointed (as are all the Parents/Grandparents that regularly attend the session) that this is one of the session that will be cut. All of us at some point attended the old Wednesday morning pop in and play, and it really isn't the same.  
For me and my daughter the Thursday am session is perfect. Not only logistically but because it is such a pleasant, calm atmosphere. My daughter is cared for by Grandparents while i work and therefore doesn't attend nursery. This is the main session she attends during the week that gives her a chance to be sociable with other children. She is extremely shy and other toddlers groups i have attended with her are far too busy and chaotic and she just doesn't like them. When you started running this session it was a god send. As i said it is such a calm, pleasant environment. It is somewhere she is familiar with as we have been attending the centre since she was 6 weeks old. She has thrived since we have been attending TT. Her confidence has grown remarkably and her social skills are clearly developing.  
On paper i appreciate that by having a Wednesday session it appears that you are still catering for the Thursday group but many of us work Wednesdays or due to past experience with that session wouldn't attend.

"mm","Communication","Communication","My Mum moved to Lings Bar after 3 weeks at the QMC and having heard good reports about it we were looking forward to her getting there. Unfortunately the experience was very disappointing.
We were led to believe that my Mum was doing well and the plan was for her to come home with additional care but when we attended the family meeting we were told that she was not responding to physio and therefore the recommendation was that she should go into a nursing home. We were completely blindsided by this since it was not what we wanted and felt rather ambushed as we were outnumbered by 5 hospital staff to 2 family members.
We should have been informed of this way before we were and we also found out later that they had stopped active physio but again we were only told of this when we asked.
My Mum was left wet and in need of changing on at least 3 occasions that we know about and when questioned why we were told they were short staffed. I understand this but it is not acceptable as my Mum had been left in that condition for quite a while.
She was sent for a scan at the QMC with less than 24 hours notice and a family member was expected to go with her - not easy to rearrange work at such short notice especially when we were not told that she needed a scan in the first place. A meeting with the social worker was also arranged with less than a days notice - on both occasions when we asked for them to be changed we were told that if they were changed we might have to wait for a while so we really had no choice but to go ahead.
To finish off the poor experience they were supposed to inform us when she left Lings Bar to go to the nursing home but they rang us an hour and a half after she had left meaning she arrived at the home on her own.
On a positive note the staff were all lovely and, apart from the aforementioned lack of personal care, treated my Mum with kindness and respect. It was just a shame that the whole experience was let down by poor communication and failure to keep family members fully informed. Hopefully this can be rectified in the future so other families do not have such a disappointing time there.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",601

[Very happy with 'Being listened to']  
Where do I start....? I am very impressed and delighted that I was offered carer support while my daughter has been going through hell and back. It has been a nightmare for the whole family. As a family we felt so alone and misunderstood.  
As a mother my family is my world and I have never thought about my own health and wellbeing, (I did not even know what wellbeing was) but these support sessions, were focused on me and how I am feeling - for the first time ever, I have been able to understand my own emotions, before that they were just unknown feelings that either made me cry, withdraw, get a burning feeling in my stomach, or have a stomach ache. Now I know that its sadness, angry, frustration, guilt, anxieties.  
I have never been used to this; I am from a family with a 'stiff upper lip' attitude. We never talked about feelings. I have a lot to learn but I am keen to focus on myself.  
I’ve finally been given a copy of my daughter’s crisis plan and wellness plan, which is something I’ve never had before despite asking many times and getting nowhere.  
This service needs to be promoted more; there are 100s of people needing support. Caring for someone who is mentally ill is draining and while I love my daughter, I have been struggling for 8 years - feeling so helpless and hopeless, but by god, do I thank you – you are a clever, well grounded, caring, inspiring, and motivational person. You have made a massive difference to my life and for that I will be always grateful.  
I have been meaning to write this for months, but then forgot. I saw a sign in the hospital, which prompted my memory.

"ca","Care received","Activities","The Live Team are the most important team which help to co-ordinate, support and enable patients to achieve their independence in a way that is suitable to them, using the person centred approach with a holistic caring, supporting concern.  
Particularly, the allotment where patients can relax, enjoy the sunshine or shade and generally chill out, provides an hour of peace and freedom of mind to some patients who are locked in wards but can escape to their small taste of freedom down here in the garden allotment with escorted leave. Here the patients become gardeners and people with their individual knowledge and memories and then they become the person they have always been. They find themselves in this garden.  
The 'Live' Team, also go on to the wards and use pampering and relaxation techniques to improve the dignity & self esteem of the clients who are unable. for whatever reason to leave the ward. These 'Live' services are important and crucial to our residents and help us to reduce cravings to undertake unhealthy smoking practices.

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","I started my counselling with the O.M. service in Leicester in January 2018 following an initial phone assessment in July 2017. I was told I was at the top of the list for an appointment in December 2017. A short delay followed before I received my first appointment because I was only available on certain specific days and times owing to work commitments.
I was treated with respect and dignity by my counsellor 'A' at all times. I suffer with Social Anxiety Disorder . I was taught various relaxation techniques and received EMDR for  a couple  of specific incidents that happened in my past.
Most of the appointments in the first few months were weekly which was good as it helped my counsellor and I to build up an adequate relationship.
I was offered a choice of venues to receive my counselling which was most helpful as I had  to rely on public transport to get there.
My treatment finished in mid July. I made some progress in dealing with my issues though probably not as much as I had originally hoped. This is no reflection on my counsellor who worked hard for me, but unfortunately I suffered a major loss of confidence three quarters of the way through my treatment following a severe emotional upset at my place of work.
I think perhaps my counsellor would have liked to have made greater progress with me and was probably frustrated that despite trying everything open to her I was not able to respond to the treatment to a greater degree.
Despite this I would recommend this service to any one with mild to moderate mental health issues.
I pleased to be told though by 'A' at the conclusion of my last session that I could reapply for further therapy after 6 months.","2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",620

They made time for us, we felt heard and never dismissed.  
It identified better which communication problems our son struggles with, and how better to communicate with him, like giving processing time, shorter instructions. It was also helpful to get the very useful handouts about assertive communication. Plus advice on useful books and a social group we were not aware of . We tried out both, the group was not a good fit and the book we ordered had unrealistic scenarios, but it was nice we were given all this information.  
It also helped that the therapist was a lovely, cheerful person that our son was mostly happy to engage with. She was also very accommodating as to fitting us in at times that suited us best and was happy to do a home visit because it was still an effort to get our son to attend.  
Because our son could sell ice to eskimos, you are not aware of him having these problems with understanding and processing . Also when you have children with ASD, PDA ect. you fear to be seen as weak parents all the time, so you try to be stricter, impose more boundaries as you are told to do, but actually this makes things worse. With giving processing time it does make home life a lot better.  
There are still occasions where he lashes out for unknown reasons. Maybe more advice on possibly anger management or what other avenues to pursue would be helpful.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",679
"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","My daughter has severe speech difficulties . We were happy for a quick appointment , within a couple of weeks of being referred . We could choose where we were seen, which we arranged by ringing a number ( which took several attempts as no one answers and we couldn’t leave a message) but what you think is the start of treatment is just the start of another huge wait.  
The therapist, although professional, was quite off hand at times when we were asking questions and asking for activities to do at home. The assessment was very short, one book was used and we weren’t able to ask many questions. We were given some general ideas which were helpful but nothing that was particular to our daughter and nothing that we could sit down and do even though was asked for ideas of how to help at home and what school could do. We were told that it would take 6-12 months for someone from a different team to see her in school. This is far too long!  
The therapist explained it was due to funding cuts and lack of staff , which we understand , but 12 months to wait for your child to be seen when no one can understand them feels too long . It feels like the assessment was pointless .. as she will need another assessment as she’s waited so long. We have recently been told that our daughter won’t be seen In school but we have to go to clinic and won’t be seen by a specialist after all as they have changed how they work in the 11 months since we were assessed .

"ca","Care received","Activities","I post as a catherine wheel, but today I could post as a success story. Don't hold your breath, you won't be hearing ""success"" and the local ""Mental Health System"" in the same sentence from me very often. Most definitely not now I'm a woman in the Certain Ages - nothing to lose, everything to gain!  
I'm located in the local mental health ""services"" City East, based at the Stonebridge Centre in Nottingham. Now here's the success :  
VOICEBOX  
It's one of those group things held somewhere around here on Thursdays. It's for people who have voice hearing experiences who would like to have a cracking good life, relate to people, go to places and events etc feeling a tad more ok about their voice hearing experiences. Yes, we do still take our voices with us. Oh well!!  
VOICEBOX is about us lot getting together to share our suggestions of things to try, stuff we've read about, accounts of someone who knows someone who tried this, we pool our knowledges and skills and strategies, etc. We do this in a safe group so we can pick up out the pool and work on and explore all our stuff so that we can for ourselves work out what we can put into place ourselves to have our cracking good times. We share how we've got on, what tweaks we've made to get something to work for us. Sometimes one of us does a strategy and shares: Never, oh, no, no, no, never again! We're here for each other - a laugh, a celebration, a pick us up in our bad bits. It's ours. We call the shots. Go at our paces. We can attend for as long as we want. And we can leave when we think, yeah, I'm done here.  
Yes, we do make mistakes, especially me! And we make fantastic discoveries, and successes of things. And on the strength of all this my success story is: I've quit. Yes, a couple of weeks or so ago, I quit VOICEBOX. Whopping success. For VOICEBOX, for all persons VoiceBox, and for me. Because I feel it's the right time for me. No, I've not learnt it all, no I can't use strategies and manage my voice hearing perfectly. And most definitely not every single time! But I've quit because VOICEBOX has got me here. Because everyone at VOICEBOX is a success, because we don't make inflated claims and share falsehoods about what we can do. I quit because I'm a success because VOICEBOX never sets anyone up to fail and hence become the victim of their voices.  
It's a facilitated closed group so if you're interested you would have to get in touch with a sorter outer. Just ask around. It might not be the group for you. But it's worth exploring. I don't know what we gargle with at VOICEBOX but you know, you might find it tastes rather nice! I reckon VOICEBOX is a NHS treasure. Sorry all you other Trusts!  
Round here I reckon VOICEBOX steals all the gems in our local crown. But don't think for one minute I'm letting our Trust get complacent. Come on... what do you expect? It's the top gems and jewels in a sometimes tarnished local crown! I'm in the Certain Ages now, remember!

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","I have been under the mental health team at stonebridge since my last hospital admission in December last year. My mental health has deteriorated since June and have been seeing the duty team. We came to a decision that I needed a medication review with the consultant. The consultant I used to see had recently left the team so after nearly a 2 month wait, I got in with a locum consultant.  
Both appointments left me feeling frustrated, upset, and wary of the decisions being made. The consultant hadn't read my notes so didn't know the reason for the appointment. In fact, the first question was; ""have you ever seen a psychiatrist before"". After telling them my concerns over my medication, it was dismissed and I was made to feel like I was looking for a ""magic pill"" fix, where in fact I am aware medication won't cure me; a point I made to the consultant. I got upset and was emotional due to anxiety and my low mood. This wasn't acknowledged. After my medication concerns were dismissed, and the consultant hadn't heard of the mentalization therapy I'd been in under NHS for a year, I got up to leave. The consultant asked me to sit down which I did. They then spent 5mins in silence, looking in the bnf. Then decided to take me off one of my medications (not the one I had raised concerns about) and wanted me to start a new one. By this point, I was emotionally exhausted and frustrated by the consultants tone and manner so I accepted what they said and left.  
I was very emotional for the rest of the day and needed to phone the duty team. I spoke to a nurse who helped me understand as the consultants notes said more than they had told me in the appointment. Why they chose the new medication. The acknowledgement of my mood. I was told I could tell my story here but I decided to give the consultant the benefit of doubt.  
Turns out the new medication prescribed isn't available on the NHS. And following a phone call from the pharmacist in my gp surgery, the consultant had decided to reduce the dose of another medication without consulting me. In fact, I believe the consultant had misread my notes and believed I was on a lower dose than I was, and following a chat with my pharmacist, decided I should be on the lower dose anyway.  
I rang the Stonebridge centre the next day to clarify what the plan was, and to highlight the error. The reception staff and the consultant secretary were as confused as me as my notes clearly stated my original dose of medication. And were confused why I would be prescribed a medication unavailable on NHS. They arranged for me to come in ASAP to resolve the issue. I requested someone to sit in the appointment with me as I felt uncomfortable seeing the same consultant.  
The nurse on duty sat in. This appointment had similar frustration, confusion and made me upset. The consultant's mistake over medication dose and decision behind my back were barely acknowledged as a mistake and I was made to feel a burden as they had to take time out to speak to the pharmacist and again to me today. They didn't apologise about prescribing a medication I couldn't get on the NHS, and spent more time trying and failing to log into my notes than actually talking to me. The nurse was fantastic and supportive. She helped me come to a decision about medication and make a plan forward. The consultant tried to give me another new medication which I declined, and took a long time to catch up on what medication I was on and make a plan. If it wasn't for the nurse, I'd have reached breaking point. The medication review was suppose to be helpful, not stressful.  
I understand stresses on the NHS and workloads. I understand that mistakes can happen. But the lack of communication and apology, along with being made to feel like I was causing more work was unacceptable. It triggered intrusive thoughts, paranoia, and I felt fed up. I have seen many consultants. And each one has a different view and preference on medication. I am tired of changing medication to meet the new consultants preference.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",719

"da","Dignity","Respect For Diversity/ Person-Centeredness","I live in the Nottingham Citry area & have been under the care of the LMHT for some time. Recently I had an appointment booked with my worker at my home address & after 20 minutes or so they still hadn't arrived. I called their work mobile several times, but it went straight to voicemail. I became increasingly anxious as recently I'd been forgetting appointments & getting days/dates confused & I started to think I'd forgotten the date, written it down incorrectly & that my concentration must be slipping again which is a sign for me things are slipping again. I was also concerned that the worker may have had an accident en route. I eventually called the office and was told firstly the worker wasn't in & then that they were off sick.  
I was extremely annoyed as no one had had the courtesy of even letting me know - as such I also felt extremely disrespected. Despite then leaving details of why I needed to speak with someone that day (or have some assurance that the issue was being dealt with), no one even bothered to return my call, or even apologise.  
Eventually I had to call another organisation involved in my care who returned my call within 30 minutes and were able to deal with the immediate issue.  
Despite mental health services in general being obviously under staffed, I feel the office really does need to have more efficient admin systems in place and more of an appreciation that they are sometimes dealing with some individuals such as myself, who can on occasion become easily distressed & anxious & may take situations or events more personally than others.","-2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",759

"ap","Access","Provision of services","Last week I received a letter from my CPN cancelling my next appointment. In this letter they made no arrangements for me to access my medication - they usually bring me my medication to my appointments.  
To give this some context, I have no support. I am at crisis point. I am struggling enormously with trying to stop myself from taking my own life. The city crisis team won’t work with me because I didn’t ‘sound’ distressed enough on the phone to them. As an aside it might be useful if the crisis team could produce guidance on how they expect ‘crisis’ to be performed for them. I do not understand why they would think I am lying but if there are specific words or actions that would have convinced them of my need, that would be useful information. I don’t understand how they have made an assessment based on what I sound like and suspect this is essentially a biased assessment that I failed due to not being neurotypical (When i said this to the person on the phone I was told this wasn’t true as they had spoken very clearly. Their speech was not the issue, it was the capacity to listen, understand and make an assessment, which is clearly flawed as they were essentially telling me I was lying when I was not).  
In this context my medication is the only thing I have that helps me cope.  
I have phoned the team every day this week asking how I can get my medication. Duty have consistently told me my CPN will be in touch, but this has not happened.  
This situation is obviously impacting negatively on an already difficult situation as I do not know if I will have access to the only thing left to me to help me stay alive.  
It’s not fair to not only have nothing to offer me when I am struggling to keep myself alive but also to make this situation worse through lack of communication and putting me in a situation where I don’t even know if I can have my medication. This means I don’t know if my current very difficult mental state is going to get worse through not being able to manage it with medication like I usually do. This kind of uncertainty is not conducive to good mental health.  
This is the second time recently that my medication has been messed about with. Last time I had to request it very many times over a number of weeks and then ask a social worker to request it ( more than once. They refused my social workers request the first time too. I have never been told the reason for this, just that I can complain if I want to. I don’t want to complain, I just would like my medication). I had weeks without medication and given the complete lack of any other support offered it’s not fair to just randomly withhold the one thing I have that helps me cope.  
Fortunately while writing this my GP has returned my emergency request for a phone call and agreed to prescribe me a weeks worth of my medication while I continue to attempt to make contact with my mental health team. Hopefully this will be enough time, it took far longer than a week last time they randomly withdrew my medication.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",769

I am a stay-at-home Mum and with my little one in morning nursery I was feeling a little lost and undervalued. I wanted to go back to work but also didnt want to miss out on the school pickups and afternoons with my youngest.  
The EPEC course was well delivered in a down to earth and practical way. I felt well supported to then deliver the Being a Parent Course (BAP) to parents at Mansfield Woodhouse Childrens Centre. Through small changes and with me being busy training or planning, my husband has begin to realise that when I do go back to work, the childcare situation will have to change, which has been important in increasing my confidence.  
I had previously applied for evening jobs and found that the gaps in my work history from having my children were preventing me from even getting an interview! I was feeling useless, but the EPEC course and delivering the BAP course helped me to realise that I can help other parents who are feeling the same as me, and had experienced the same situations as I have. I'm looking forward to delivering the next course!","1","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",776

"da","Dignity","Respect For Diversity/ Person-Centeredness","Over the past month I experienced upsetting and frustrating customer service from the reception. Whenever I have to request something from my psychiatrist, usually of an important matter, the receptionist never gives any definite or clear answers to my questions and sometimes doesn't pass my messages across, or they get lost within the short space of the reception walls.
I have requested a diagnosis letter a week ago. They told me to keep calling since, until today when they said to stop calling and that they'll call me instead. I still haven't got a clue when this letter will be ready.
Another time it was for something even more important. I ran out of a prescription and after trying to request it directly from my GP without positive outcome, I contacted the Rushcliffe Mental Health practice and requested the reception to request this prescription to my psychiatrist. I kept calling and asking please to let me know as soon as possible as I felt very panicky and my sleep worsened lately. I kept calling for 3 days but they said very bitterly every time that the prescription wasn't ready. I requested to speak to a duty worker, twice, but they never called me back (every time they were in a reunion). After that I called the 111 service and they told me to call back the practice and to tell them that they had to give me the prescription within 24 hrs. The day after my psychiatrist saw me at the practice and he apologised but he said that he only got told of my request the day before, and not the week before.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",786

"da","Dignity","Respect For Diversity/ Person-Centeredness","I feel the need to share my experiences in the hope that it might help someone else, or that the mental health services might help someone else, unlike me.  
After a few years of stability I began to struggle recent and was, reluctantly, referred to the Mansfield (Notts) crisis team. I say reluctantly due to past experiences where I felt patronised. However, I accepted that this was a couple of years ago and agreed to try again after considering suicide.  
I had several encounters. A couple were positive, and I spoke to two people (I wish I knew their names but I was too distressed to retain the information) who listened on the phone, spoke to me, rationisalised what was happening and got me through the crisis. They gave me hope and arranged plans on how to move forward.  
This was overshadowed by the other times when I was patronised, ignored and made to feel as though I was a complete waste of time.  
On one visit I was told that all my problems were due to a drug addiction and did not need crisis support but drug addiction counselling. I explained, I thought quite clearly, that I have absolutely no drug addiction what so ever, and this was so far off the mark it was nearly laughable. I was told I was wrong. There was no point in me even being at that meeting, the people had made up their mind before they even met me. That is not care. They made me feel invisible, told me that I have nothing to be unhappy or depressed about – that made me feel worse. They also berated me for previous contact with the crisis team and the time I had taken up. I took an overdose the next day because I had been worn down so much by this encounter that I didn’t see the point in continuing.  
On another encounter, I explained (for what felt like the 100th time) why group sessions will just not work for me. If I could go to a group counselling session I would, but I can't even be in rooms with people at times, and verbal communication can be near impossible on occasions. I was told I just need to try mindfulness and to phone the library to attend a group mindfulness training. At which point I was screaming internally, ""don't you listen to a word I say? We’ve just discussed how I am unable to go to a group."" I've since had an opportunity to try mindfulness, it really does not work for me on any level, irritates me to the point where I self-harmed during the session. I won't be trying it again.  
So, after yet another series of degrading encounters, I now have absolutely zero support from any mental health services and I've given up trying. Next time someone encourages me to speak to the crisis team I’ll tell them that it’s safer not to.  
These are just a couple of my experiences, there are a dozen more that follow a similar theme unfortunately. There are also other positive experiences – I do not want to detract from those who are doing their best to help people, but perhaps if I had actually been listened to on all those occasions when I tried to explain what the problems were – instead of being told that I’m wrong, and I should just be happy, and I just need to try mindfulness – then I may be in a better place.  
There are some people there that try and help and to those I thank you. Unfortunately, the probability of speaking to one of these people is so low that I will not be risking it again. There’s only so much you can take. I am no better, I am struggling every single day, but I guess there’s not much I can do about that, I tried asking for help like people say – it didn’t work, not even close, not even when I was desperate.

When L*** was 6 weeks old i moved back to the local area, i started to go to baby group every Thursday, i loved it, made some lovely friends and Karen and Paula was always there to give advice.  
At 20 weeks old L*** had a seizure and continued to have them. i felt vulnerable and was a little afraid to take L*** out for what people would say and stop and stare. after a week or so i started back at baby group, i felt safe here, the support i got was amazing. My life then took a turn for the worse, my mum had a massive life changing stroke which she now relies on everyone for all aspects of daily living, mum was my support and over night it had been taken away i had no one to ask for help and advice due to mum's illness it caused family problems so i also lost connection with my family  
Karen and Paula helped me through the darkest days. you can read a million books but they don't tell you how to play with your child listen to your child and understand your child when ever i needed some one to talk to or needed advice they have always smiled and helped me, as i watched L*** grow I've realized I've made mistakes. She is so full of life and character, L***don't always listen to what i am saying and can just do her own thing and become challenging when i try to interact, i think due to L***'s epilepsy i never really enforced boundaries.  
The now i am two group is really helping me with that ive seen such an improvement in L***'s behavior and attitude, i can see her develop week by week ands she has started to develop her own personality you can really see what she enjoys.  
This group is definitely helping as well has L*** benefiting from the group as a mum its also helped me, at present i have depression due to family issues this group is one thing i look forward to, i also feel more confident in being a mum. Thank you to both of you from the bottom of my heart

I was admitted to the City Hospital in Nottingham for 4/5 days. After a CT of my head I was given an infusion via a canula and drugs to lower my blood pressure, the latter continued for the whole of my stay. I had to be barrier nursed because in April 2018 I was on a ward in the QMC in Nottingham where someone had an infection not treatable by antibiotics. I was tested on days 1 and 3 but came home on day 5 so was unable to get the third test and therefore the all clear. All the hospital staff were wonderful! Soon after returning home the Stroke Team started to visit me and have come regularly ever since. Emma from the team has done so much to help me including giving me exercises and suggesting and obtaining equipment for me such as a Fishcer walking stick. The stroke psychologist also visited me and she was very nice too. At Emma's suggestion I have started a new exercise class called ENGAGE Get-up And Go Exercises, which is very good for me.

"ap","Access","Provision of services","I was refused a service. I was given no credible reason for this decision, despite asking for this on several occasions. The staff concerned made sweeping statements that bore no relevance to the nature of the assessment process and what was discussed, and was almost wholly inaccurate.
The staff member ""kindly"" offered that I could see another staff member , as though this was supposed to offer me an untainted assessment process, devoid of any infringement on my assessment process above that of the need for staff to ""get on"" (hardly credible).
The staff member fed back to me about some elements of the conversation during the assessment process that she felt deemed me unsuitable for their service, whilst having asked me about these issues in the first place!!,
I also felt that she made a comment that she had neither the information nor knowledge upon which to make such a judgement that, for someone less sure of their footing, could have undermined all the pain and heartache that had been involved to come to terms with what I had already resolved in my own mind. I found this arrogant as well as totally devoid of professional care nor responsibility; and totally disrespectful to me and the process I have had to go through in order to rebuild something of a life for myself.
I suspect the staff member has never had to struggle in such a way, hence her ability to dismiss this with such ease and lack of integrity.
The staff member even asserted that she could not work with people dynamics patients brought to discuss at the service unless she was on site!! And didn't even seem to think that ""people to people"" issues are not are areas they work on!! She asserted that they deal with ""trauma cases"". I wonder what ""traumas""? Breaking a leg skiing!! Or looking down when rock climbing!!
Very strange comment.
The building itself was dingy-typical of old mental institutions. It was drably decorated and clinical/devoid of pleasantness in its outlook. If you weren't low in spirits before you went to St Annes House, you would be by the time you had been in there for any length of time.
I notice on their website there is no information about the  level of Equality nor Diversity of the staff nor cases taken on/rejected. Hardly ""transparent"".
A series of ""declarations"" (ie policy statement) hardly gives any real idea of what this organisation is in relation to E&Diversity in reality.
As a consequence, I have had to submit a FOI request to obtain the information in relation to people referred and people subsequently offered a service. Poor.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",854

My post concerns our Wi-Fi.  
How about giving us access to our Wi-Fi in the refreshment outlets run by Options in our local mental health services? Perhaps in the lovely Cafe Art.  
Currently at Cafe Art only the Trust’s staff can use our Wi-Fi, as the password is withheld from the rest of us. The local services are part of the NHS, and are paid for mainly from the public purse. The spirit of the NHS is for it to be there when we need it, and free at the point of access. It is our NHS, collectively accessed and owned, by all of us.  
Cafe Art might be a public/private partnership where we do pay for the latte when we order it. Sadly we do not collectively own that. We do though own the Wi-Fi which is served up in Cafe Art along with the latte. You know, a skinny latte and a slice of our Wi-Fi would go down a treat for me. Like the staff I too would enjoy savouring my laptop to the full.  
I feel like re-inventing myself as a Service Loser without the Wi-FI. I’m sure access to our Wi-Fi would contribute greatly to my mental stealth and waywarding. And most appropriately in a cafe, these things mushroom, and before you know it, lots of other peoples’ mental stealth will steep.

Those that know me have always said I should have been a Social Worker, however the enormous responsibility of such a role always deterred me. Instead I worked with children and families in various roles, though could never really effect the change I wanted to.  
Having worked as a teacher in a school whose pupils were often from deprived areas, I began to realise that social work might be a better place for me to make positive change for others. The real budge for this that made me apply for social work training came from being an EPEC (Empowering Parents Empowering Communities) Parent group leader...  
The EPEC training programme, gave me up-to-date techniques that would allow me to support parents who wanted guidance on 'being a good enough parent'. In this role I have met some truly wonderful parents, all with their own 'back story' of the struggles they have faced and face day to day. One individuals story captured me so much, that I couldn't help but recognise how different their life may have been with the right 'input' early on in their life. They became my catalyst, all being well I will be starting my social work training very soon!  
The parent programme enabled me to meet other parents in a neutral environment, without preconceptions. The only aim was to build positive relationships so as to offer support and guidance in parenting techniques, that might yield positive outcomes.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",864

For the second time, I have attempted to access this service for CBT. I have been waiting patiently for an appointment to be offered to me since before Christmas and this week, I received a call offering me an appointment. I am a first time Mum to a 13 month old. I work two and a half days a week since returning from maternity leave in a job that I have worked hard for. I explained that I would have to bring my child with me to my appointment and the response was that the therapist would not allow this. I explained that I understood it was not always appropriate to bring a child to these appointments so asked for an evening or weekend appointment but of corse, this service is only available for those that do not work because their hours are only 9-5. I am unsure what the expectation therefore is; I have childcare arranged for the days that I work and the days that I do not work, I am a mother. My husband also works full time so he is not available to look after our child during the day. If I am unable to attend an appointment without my child then am I discharged from the service without any treatment or support at all? No doubt this will be recorded in my records as 'lack of engagement' as I have seen many times in my job as a Social Worker. I question how many other people are let down by this service because of similar reasons, how many mothers are unable to get childcare to attend these appointments, how many men are too ashamed to ask their work for time off to deal with their mental health problems. A mental health service that is only available during 9-5 hours in discriminatory and oppressive and it is no wonder there are so many people struggling.

The activities on offer are always stimulating and fun, giving the children the chance to undertake play that might not normally be on offer at home and inspiring parents/carers to try these themselves. During my time at these sessions I have seen the service users coming to staff with issues, some openly discussed and I imagine many conversations that have taken place in a quiet space and this again can be invaluable and stop problems enlarging which must also at some point save money in the long term.  
The highly experienced staff give parents/carers confidence to help their children explore new concepts in play in a safe not judgmental environment and are always welcoming.In conclusion I hope this service can continue to offer support for grandparents like myself and invaluable play opportunities for the children of Cotgrave and the wider community.","2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",899

"ti","Transition/coordination","Coordination/Integration Of Care","I'm writing my ""story"" as I wanted to express my disbelief at the referral criteria/decison making of the Step 4 Psychology Service in Nottinghamshire.  
A referral to a psychology service was first suggested to me by my psychiatrist in early 2016 following discharge from Highbury Hospital in late 2015. I was discharged from Highbury on something of a cocktail of drugs - Risperidone, Citalopram and Clonazepam (I was discharged from there having been prescribed the equivalent of 30mg PER DAY).  
Prior to my admission to Highbury, I also had issues with alcohol which were the result of long standing acute anxiety and depression from a very early age.  
Since then I have worked with the local Adult Mental Health Services to manage my mental health issues and a local drug & alcohol service to drastically reduce, with the eventual aim of discontinuing my use of Diazeapam (I currently take just 2mg a day down from 30mg); I am no longer on Risperidone and I continue to work with the local alcohol & drug service to control my drinking to a safe level.  
Recently, it was felt by the LMHT, my psychiatrist & my drug/alcohol support worker that I was now at the stage where I would benefit from (and probably needed) more long term support from a service such as Step 4 to be able to make any sort of sustained recovery. The referral to Step 4 was also supported by my GP.  
Hence a referral to this service was recently made. To my utter disbelief, I have been refused access to this service and not even given the opportunity of an interview due to the level of drug use (prescribed benzodiazepines) and alcohol use.  
I do wonder if staff in this service have any understanding at all of how challenging it is been to reduce Diazepam intake having been prescribed it very long term, at the same time as also controlling alcohol intake whilst also managing mental health issues.  
This ""decision"" feels like a total slap in the face and to not even be offered the opportunity of even a brief interview I feel is atrocious.  
I would be very interested to know if any of the other services involved in my care were even consulted before this decision was reached.","-2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",901

"cr","Care received","Rules/approach to care","Below I’ve listed a series of areas where I think improvements could be made for patients going forward. These may seem minor but in a situation like this, every little thing helps._Phone chargers _Provide patients with short lead chargers, so they can charge their phones without risk of strangulation. Have a set of short cable, pre-pack tested, multi-cable usb plugs in each bedroom. This would allow patients to charge any device in their own time instead of having to rely on the ward for this, losing access to communication with loved ones. You could have a few of these ready in the ward and patients could loan one with a deposit to make sure they don’t get lost._Walking policy _At no point should a patient feel they are being deprived of exercise or fresh air. I knew a patient wanted to go the gym and train more than anything else, so much so that they absconded in order to achieve this. As a result, they were deprived of going outside at all, with no access to fresh air (their room window was even locked as a result of this) – this is not an appropriate response. If somebody attempts to leave the ward or absconds, they should be given a guided care plan which tells them on which day they will be allowed back out, on which day they will be allowed on an escorted walk, and what they have to do to achieve unescorted leave. The current system makes this much too vague for patients. They need clear ‘If this then that’ statements, which show that if you try to escape you get 7 days without leave, and then after that point you are allowed to walk unescorted. Clarity is key in moments where you are trying to make a patient comply. They can’t comply with rules they aren’t being given._Plants and windows _As for the windows, these should have safety latches installed which limit their opening so people can’t fit out of them, and they should never be locked otherwise you deprive the brain of oxygen and make the patient less well. If you are going to deprive people of oxygen, you should provide plants in the room to help provide some oxygen._Peer support workers. _This is something that I approved of and found really helpful. The idea of having people who have been through the same situation on the ward is fantastic. My only feedback here is that access to a one to one with a peer support worker who has either your condition or something close to it, should be mandatory for each patient during their stay – provide more peer support workers and have them keep doing what they’re doing!_Talking therapy _Talking therapy should be available to those who need it, or in a group setting. Letting the patients in the hospital really get to know each other through facilitated talking sessions would help them bond and feel calmer in each other’s presence. And having a member of staff to talk to (even if its not a trained therapist) would be really helpful. My suggestion would be that a one to one with a chosen staff member each week be mandatory for all patients and group talking sessions also provided in the ward._Sports and exercise _Other physical activities such as sport could also be encouraged more to help patients bond. After about a week in there one of the patients brought a football in and we had a kickabout. I don’t even play football at home but having this was great for making us feel happier and healthier and more bonded._Musical instruments _If patients play musical instruments at home for their mental health (such as piano in my case) frequent access to this would really help their condition. I was eventually allowed access to the piano for 30 minutes a day on weekdays, but unescorted access on weekends would have helped me greatly. If patients are allowed to leave the ward unescorted, they should also be allowed to play an instrument unescorted, especially if the room isn’t being used for anything else at the time._Healthier food options _There is a connection between what you eat and how you think, a fruit bowl on the ward would be great for improving patients physical and mental health._Weekends _Weekends were the hardest due to a lack of staff. When the patients outnumber the staff, the energy on the ward becomes negative and hostile. If you are going to get volunteer support coming in, or any extra heads, get them on weekends when they are most needed._Jobs _Patients should be offered jobs around the ward to feel occupied. This could be anything from making tea to sweeping floors. Coming from working full time to having nothing to do is difficult._Final thoughts _In people’s time of need we look up to those who are well to help us recover. This hospital is primarily a place of recovery. Using occupational therapy to help patients feel well again, having guided timetables and care plans for each patient so they know where they are, roughly how long they will be there and what steps they need to take to get better are crucial for recovery.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",910

"xx","Miscellaneous","Null/inappropriate","I’m A Catherine Wheel and I’ve been a regular in the world of mental health since 1979. I started out here in Local Mental Health Services Nottingham,(currently accessing the Stonebridge Centre, Team East), returned sometimes, and came back here to keep a promise. I’ve overstayed, and will soon be off to live at the seaside! However I’d like to post some musings about my life and times here with LMHS Nottingham and follow them up with more detailed posts on some of them before I leave. My services begin in 1979, but the subsequent detailed posts will concentrate solely on now.  
Since 1979 LMHS Nottingham’s been like this for me:  
Back then  
port in a storm  
A time of  
sailing by  
Recently  
rocking the boat  
making waves  
Nowish  
woman overboard - clueless about how lovely the water is  
My recent LMHS Nottingham experience has been disappointing, mixed, good, and great. Like this:-  
The good:  
Ace people: all recent: Much loved Vivienne, (now gone), Gordon (hanging on), Kieran (now gone), thank you.  
Alex who is putting up with me: this pain in your neck, giver of disproportionate sticks, eater of all the carrots (being a veggie! ). I don’t know how you are doing this. Can’t think why you haven’t refused to work with me. Glad you're around . Coming off Seroxat is really something else!  
Cafe Art: Lovely staff; great latte! Pity about the telly and the QI Hive take over.  
Those unforgettable consultations with Dr Sara, (once consultant psychiatrist of these parts to around 2016):  
The aaaaaafternoon tea at the Ritz ones, and the greasy spoon consultations you gentled me to when required.  
The time when Sara, and I swept the board and the carpet saw red at the Oscars, for that rant of a lifetime far exceeding expectations. (Thus also worthy of an Ofsted). Your quietly confident line: “Is there anything else you would like to tell me today?”  
You listened and you helped. Despite your abrupt leave taking I hope you too are having a ball. Many happy retirements Sara!  
The mixed and some of the disappointing  
Having to DIY my mental health as much as I am expected to do here. I would have liked connection, and a woman counsellor to talk to. Alex is trying to get counselling for me now. I have though felt alone with it all. Lost. Missing. Absent. Standing next to myself often. There has been unnecessarily deep hurt, pain, yearning, struggle. I did have a social worker and support worker in Wales right until I came back here. Yet it gave, does give, me the freedom to make my own decisions, try things beyond the present thinking here. To think and see more widely with others on the outside of health and social care. To be mixed up, making things up, muddled, mistaken, and rounded. Like life is.  
The Trust’s involvement, co-stuff, peer stuff. It’s good to make improvements to what there is, keep up and raise standards. But can other things be done? How about looking at how distress, anguish, pain, despair, sorrow, fear, suffering, uncertainty, grinding down, etc become “health” issues? How about involvement with and co-production of a paradigm shift? Perhaps around how can we live together and organise life so we don’t need services like these in the first place?  
Sometimes I’ve longed for a space for us to question and debate. To think critically and broadly on topics, reflect, and represent things together. Things affecting us here like: Recovery, Journeys of Recovery, stigma, ableism, individualism, …..“The system”, so many locked doors, rationing and limiting access policies, organisational kindness, communication, provision of information, sharing knowledges. And the smartness of bees, not the QI ones, with their more flexible approach to collective wisdom. There’s so many ideas, ways to see, to relate to issues, to express them, and make them accessible to everyone.  
The great stuff of here:  
People I’ve encountered along the way.  
Voicebox: a group for voice hearers, thanks everyone you are just amazing.  
Learning that there’s a lot more to equality than opportunity.  
Appreciating that not everyone, irrespective of dreams, trying and grafting, will necessarily make it.  
Realising that we carry each other’s weight.  
To be given opportunities to use my privilege.  
  
Handing it to myself that the choice between a journey of recovery and that armchair, slippers, and good book, has been the swiftest decisive decision I’ve ever made.  
Being able to be openly honest about how I think, feel, and dream. Yes, even being able to say that at times I do lie through my wisdom teeth about the contentious matter of the medications!  
Thinking, well, maybe, you’re not that bad at LMHS Nottingham, deep down, perhaps. Having my ambivalence accepted and validated.  
Writing wish letters to Mother Christmas of our Trust.  
Laughing. Having fun. Celebrating. Lots and lots of this!  
Posting on Care Opinion and seeing that it does get results in Nottingham! Many thanks the Service Manager of City LMHS Teams East and South.

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","I do not want to go into details as I have made a formal complaint against the Aspergers Service at The Pines, Bulwell Hospital which so far I have not received a satisfactory response.  
  
In a nutshell, my daughter was not treated well at all by this service, both her and myself are most disappointed and I would not encourage anyone else to use it, if they would be treated the way in which my daughter was.  
The staff there need to appreciate that they are dealing with adults who have 'Aspergers Syndrome', hence many people mask their condition, which includes their feelings; as professional staff they should be able to detect that.  
There is far too much of a 'bull in a China shop' approach, in my opinion.  
Maybe that was just my daughter's experience but I expect them to make much more of an effort to engage with clients more satisfactorily.  
From our experience, we expect professionals to act professionally and this was not the case. This was most disappointing and I would be very reluctant to use the service myself and I know that my daughter feels exactly the same.

"ee","Environment/ facilities","Environment/ facilities","Hi I’m A Catherine Wheel and I access my Nottingham City East local mental health services at The Stonebridge Centre. Stonebridge is what my post is all about.  
If you go down to the Stonebridge Centre today, you’re in for a big surprise. It’s just re-opened after our co-produced refurbishment, and now you’ll hardly believe your eyes. It’s as evidence-based as a picnic under Milkwood.  
For starters the outdoor areas are litter-free; now gone the tall wire perimeter fences. The green bits are tidy, all window shutters are open, and someone’s put a bench out. You can see the signs noting the Trust being positive about mental health, quite clearly now the wire’s gone.  
Everyone can walk right in. No deserving/undeserving questions asked. No staff/people divide by entitlement to the locked door codes. And this is carried through along all those formerly locked away inside corridors. It’s a proper free for all now.  
A bit in, there’s a creative space with a repurposed table and chairs, mags and books shelf, little boxes full of ticky tacky to explore, imagine, create with, so everything looks the same and nothing like it. There’s other chairs etc too, for reading, reflecting, relaxing, and to be.  
Near by there’s a viewing area for the telly, with separate, soft, comfy chairs plus other seating for people who can’t do comfy. People decide what to watch and operate the telly themselves, like grown-ups do.  
Next there’s a table of help yourself refreshments. There’s access to several toilets, not our usual only one. No more having to dash to the gp practice up the road where you can walk in, and use theirs, without challenge, deviation or hesitation.  
The What’s the Buzz corner’s got updates from the Trust, and our co-produced “tipping points” facts, ideas, things to try sheets on such a wide range of topics. For example one about highs and lows, hearing voices, another on depression, others like - on being a thoughtful elder, anxiety, stress, a good night’s sleep. I saw the one I helped with about coming off Seroxat.. They’ve got leaflets on what principles the Services are based on. Explanations about policies and practices, what you can access from here, and how to keep in the know, and meet other service users in the same boat as you. There was info from all sorts of organisations, and about places with things to do, info about things for all our diversities, interests, and pockets. And the whole lot dated, and where it came from so no one would go away with old stuff or no leads. Yes, even all the above in a variety of presentations: pictures, song, dance, soundings , sightings, signings, hearings, ranges of colours, languages, all sorts of ways to take the message home.  
There was also our adds board for passing it on….like our skills in digital stuff, and how we can help each other with all kinds of things respectfully and safely.  
I noticed adds for us about getting together to co-make a zine, and an audio-visual. Adds to have co-realised discussions, to co-make ways to share our thoughts, findings, about what it’s like, and our collective, shared vision, shared hope, shared dream of ways to be. All our difference, all coming together with the threads that hold us in common humanities, and personhoods.  
Oh yes, I thought you might like to know the Reception staff have all been on a pamper weekend with workshops on being nice, not grumpy. They had a ball by all accounts. All’s well with the world of reception now. Like us, they just needed someone to be kind to them too.  
I looked around, at it all. And it made me feel like I’m part of all this. That together we are stronger, solider, warmer. We’re connected, interrelated, and interdependent. We did this together, thought it through, got on with it, and now we’re maintaining it together and taking it forward. Others will join in and take it over. Pass it on. All of us co-producers.  
And I remembered how we asked around for the tables and the chairs and all the stuff. The times all of us got together to make everything nice. I thought of how talented and limited people are, of hidden depths, stirrings, and undercurrents.  
And I couldn’t help myself, I smiled big time, remembering how I was given the sledge hammer to bash that intercom outside the front door, which locked the staff in, and locked us lot out, baring us lot’s entry to Stonebridge. And I revisited my proud moment when I smashed that locked door policy to smithereens, and caught a fleeting glimpse of Duncan Macmillan, smiling, as the doors of the Asylum unlocked again.  
Not quite sure how to end this post. Might have to break the second rule of writing. This is: when you’ve finished a hopey, dreamy, wishy, wayward piece, you must never, end with:

"cl","Care received","Made A Difference To My Life","Hi I'm A Catherine Wheel and I access my mental health services from the Stonebridge Centre, for the City Local Mental Health Services City East Team, Nottingham.  
My post is about the Recovery College on the Duncan Macmillan site, in Nottingham  
In Nottingham we can have 3 academic terms at the Recovery College and can take several courses each term. More courses than I could certainly have benefitted from.  
I found the courses I chose such as Anxiety Management, Mindfulness, Confidence, getting a good night's sleep, and research methods for conducting health research were all excellent and I got such a lot out of them. I'm still working on what I learnt and will do so for the rest of my life. These were all starter courses going through the basics to set people on their way. Excellent in content, well delivered and paced, fun at times, always enjoyable, with handouts etc to take away and keep. They are put together and presented and reviewed by trained service users, practitioners, and tutors from local colleges etc. The courses really are amazing. Bang on the button.  
More than just the courses though, people who attend are treated well, met with courtesy and kindness, receive a warm welcome that is carried through all the three academic terms. Also because the experience is so good, we all have a great time, enjoy meeting each other, have coffee etc together and share stories and comments etc. It's just entirely positive. We are upbeat, and hopefully this is reflected in the feedback we give at the end of our courses.  
So I just wonder if you could think about the following for us Recovery College participants to make the excellent, stunning!!!  
1. Could you think about the access only for 3 academic terms?  
3 terms for a person's entire adult life seems a little ""brief"". Yes we can cram in loads of courses in that time. I however cancelled several because there was just too much to sort out before I felt able to do the next one. The sifting, sorting my notes with the given notes, to have a handle on what I'd learned so I could put that down a bit and learn from another essential course I'd picked. So I didn't do all that many courses anyway. Plus I did fall apart and missed a course doing that!  
Also I didn't really know what I'd want for my whole life. Now I know I'd have liked to do some other courses that now I feel I could use to benefit the person I am now. I'm different now, my requirements are different too. I'm older, I have many other concerns now too. I've had my three terms, and I can't access the Recovery College anymore as long as my mortal life is. That makes me feel a bit vulnerable, on my own.  
There's bits too I'd like to ask about, eg from Anxiety Management. I'd love to ask a bit more, things I might not have got ""right"", perhaps take other stuff a bit further. But I've looked ""out there"" and can't find a course to go on anywhere else.  
2. Feedback.  
We do feedback immediately after a course. Have you thought about long-term feedback? How have we done, and how has our course helped a year or two or three down the line? What would we like covered now we've had this long-term experience of living after a course? How effective is it in the long-term etc? Do we need anything else now?  
Also we don't seem to know what happens to the feedback we give. We often said this over coffee. Do you do a report or something? If so, where are the reports, can we see them?  
3. If, say, you changed a policy that might affect people who've been there before, eg if you did change the access policy, how would we know? Do you tell former students about what's going on? If you don't do you think you will?  
4. Research  
Have you any research reports you might have compiled on things like how much a person can take in, studying, and how many courses it's effective to do at a given time? Is it a bit of a waste to cram in as many as you can? Is 3 academic terms ""right"" for learning etc?  
Have you any research or know of research that's looked into the long-term prospects for people who have attended a Recovery College, and how effective Recovery Colleges are over time?  
It would be so interesting to know what we are involved in, and how we come to be involved, to have Recovery Colleges and models, and how they do or maybe don't work for us. It' d be great to be part of it all. To think.  
Well, thanks for the Recovery College, it is excellent, and I'm a fan!

It is important that patients have the chance to go to work areas as it is part of their therapy and treatment within a high secure hospital, I think people’s placements at medium secure sometimes fail if they haven’t had the chance to go to workshops as they aren’t used to mixing with other patients and learn new skills.Having vocational areas is helpful as it helps with mental health and behavioural issues and psychological issues which can be a daily battle for some people. I have developed positive relationships with the staff in Graphics and get to meet other people like visitors who come to the area and have a good relationship with office staff who come into the workshop. I like the relaxed atmosphere, staff respect me, I can speak my mind and are accepting of patients choices and don’t discriminate. Overall the message I want to say is that going to workshops means I can be myself, it makes me feel normal and helps give me mental stability and achieve my goals.”","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",991
"mi","Communication","Amount/clarity of information","Rampton Hospital has four Carer Event Meetings every year, each one with a theme or topic that is defined by the Carers Planning Group and from feedback recieved by carers.  
At a recent Carers Event day here at Rampton Hospital, Molly Sanghera (Senior Associate & a member of the Law Society’s specialist Mental Health Review Tribunal panel) talked to a group of 40 carers about Mental Health Tribunals - what they are, how patients can access them, who is involved in the process and about their legal framework.  
Below is the feedback recieved on the day by the carers:  
• My wife and I were looking forward to this meeting due to the fact that our daughter was transferred here three months ago. We were truly not disappointed. We felt welcomed and the set up and presentation were superb. We just can’t wait for the next carer’s event. Questions were asked and answers were straight to the point and very clear. • 1. A very productive event – Talk on Tribunals is a break-through for most carers as it has been a great mystery and source of mixed information. More of such relevant talks please.2. Could we have an event focussed on the assessment of the stock in the shop after the research group has completed their research please? Many thanks.• Excellent presentation covering current update and then MHT’s. The level of detail was spot on, covering detainment and Tribunal process. As usual, catering was great. Pleased to see that presentations worked better this time around. • Our son is on X ward. It was really good to meet the Matron and see a ward staff member who we have spoken too. Her comments were encouraging and helpful. Lorna, as always, was here with a friendly smile. I did feel Deborah was able to explain food situation well. Cauliflower Broccoli Cheese lovely and naughty pudding lovely. Thanks also to Lynne Corcoran.• A lovely welcome & thank you from all members of the Family Support Team. A nice relaxed start to the carers group. Good informative updates from Louise, Adele and Lynne about the hospital, services and provisions. Thank you for that.A valuable & informative presentation from Molly S that we help most carers today. Thank you.A delicious lunch enjoyed by all, that you to the chef and his team. Also good to see a menu on the table. Thank you to you all for the preparation, planning and putting on this Carers’ Day. Thank you. • Made to feel welcome. All staff very helpfully and accommodating to us. Learned a lot about tribunals. Now have more understanding.• Molly Sanghera’s presentation was very informative. It would be nice if she could revisit when the Government have made the changes to MHA. Lunch as always – excellent – compliments to the chefs. • The hospital update was useful. Enjoyed the Mental Health Tribunal talk. Would be useful to have a few more examples, e.g. a patient’s journey and their Tribunals. Also what the Ministry of Justice component – where appropriate – is looking for and why they might have a different conclusion.Excellent lunch as per usual.• A very informative, easy to understand presentation on Mental Health Tribunals and The Mental Health Act. Pace of the day was good. Lunch excellent and a good choice. Good to meet other carers and staff.• Great presentation and information. Food was fantastic. Lovely atmosphere as usual. Lots of new people. Regards Anabela.• A very nice, informative and productive day. The only negative is that all questions should be left until the end. It seems to be the same 1 or 2 people with a barrage of questions, which can get irritating at times!• Very welcome, as always, clear and informative displays with relevant information to take away. Excellent lunch. Information re: changes within Rampton is good and necessary.Presentation re: Tribunals I found too detailed – but I’ve not been involved in the process – and may be better summarised under generic headings.• As always a really well organised and well placed event. It has been a great help to get a better understanding of the Tribunal process and in particular the meanings of the various restrictions.Many thanks to the speaker Molly and all of the hospital staff involved. Thank you. • The carers’ event was very helpful to me and my family. We found it very informative for us. Food was lovely. Thank you.• We arrived late, unexpectedly, and were nonetheless made to feel welcome. The subject matter was (necessarily) dry but well-presented and done so as effectively as it could’ve been. Food; fantastic and innovative as ever. Really important session thanks as we’ve ultimately always been excluded from the Tribunals. Particularly appreciate the opportunity to speak to staff in an informal setting.

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","Back in September 2018 a Gedling District Nurse carried out an Incontinence assessment, and advised that mum needed more absorbent protection at night. Mum wasn't coping following her discharge from hospital and her neighbours were worried about her safety. I was forced find a Care Home that could take her at short notice. Although the Care Home is less than 10 miles from her house it's in a different District of Nottinghamshire. The new district, Mansfield & Ashfield, couldn't accept the results of the assessment already done in September, but a new assessment carried out in January reached the same conclusion as the earlier one. I complained about what I felt were unacceptable and needless delays, and highlighted the costs of me buying and delivering the incontinence products mum needed at night.  
The person who investigated my complaint demonstrated a complete lack of compassion and understanding. They verified the sequence of events, and confirmed that both District Nurses had advised that a different product was needed at night, but then callously concluded that mum should have made do with the less absorbent pads that had already been delivered.  
I am shocked and disgusted that anyone, particularly someone from a caring profession should ever think it's alright for an 88 year-old lady to have to suffer 5 months of nights with leaking pads, soiled nightwear and sodden sheets. I am extremely upset about the investigator's assertion that there was no need for me to buy the items mum has in fact needed since September. Although mum has Dementia she is acutely aware of the problem and gets very distressed about it. To suggest that she didn't need the right products from September when the first assessment was completed is in my opinion cruel and heartless.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1002

"dd","Dignity","Dignity: General","After attempting suicide I was taken to Bassetlaw hospital.  
I was initially kept for hours in a room having no space to lie down to sleep in, uncomfortable chairs, and a lack of food until a police officer raised it for the third time to staff members.  
I was then carted in a van from where I was to Bassetlaw, with two drivers who couldn't speak very good English, and ignored my requests for a toilet and water stop at service stations a number of times. Travelling backwards in a van facing a cage, being deprived of bathroom and water stops is inhumane, regardless of somebody's mental state, especially when they have the heating on full blast for the whole journey.  
When I arrived in Bassetlaw I was seen by a very tired looking member of staff, who seemingly begrudgingly asked a handful of questions which were already answered in reports transferred from the previous hospital. I don't blame the staff member for this - I imagine they were very tired and woken up at an unsociable hour, only to then perform a full day shift the following day. Just from a patient point of view, it doesn't feel helpful at all.  
I was given a bed and I think this is where my mental health started to get worse.  
I have the greatest sympathy with other patients and their conditions, but also have to recognise when these conditions prevent yourself from getting better. I slept so little that my fitness tracker didn't recognise any sleep through the first two nights. There were patients with obsessive noisy exercising, talking to self, screaming nightmares, or early morning shouting at staff for trying to administer medication. In a shared ward this makes it really difficult to get sleep. If you can't get sleep, you get agitated. If you get agitated you don't recover.  
What also doesn't help you recover is the lack of balanced diet. Each day you are given a menu for the next day to choose your brekkie/dinner/tea. It was really difficult to choose options which resulted in you getting your 5 fruit/veg a day. As an example, if you order a large veg pie, there is probably 0.5 of a portion of veg inside. This is bearing in mind recent reports which suggest 5 fruit/veg a day is actually quite low. You can do it if you add fruit as a side to every meal, but 5 a day should be weighted more to veg than fruit.  
Because of the shared nature of the ward, activities are limited. Some days there are activities scheduled, but they're not announced, and they sometimes don't run at all. The communal areas are ok, but with 12 people watching the same TV, you don't get much choice. If Jezza Kyle and Judge Rinder aren't your bag, you might want to get some books in. There are CDs, but no CD player. There are DVDs, but you need to find a staff member to change the DVD.  
A lot of these are patient safety concerns, but having all patients in the same space just frustrates other patients. While I was staying here I regularly witnessed patients frustrated with others' conditions, inability to concentrate, etc.  
My main concern was that I was lied to a number of times, probably accidentally and through miscommunication. When I left the hospital I was in to go to Bassetlaw I was told that I was fine to go home providing somebody was travelling with me - a friend or family member. When I arrived in Bassetlaw I was told that I could ask to leave but was threatened with a Section 5 order which would restrain me in hospital and told in no uncertain terms that I would then be given section 2 or 3 because they 'didn't know much about me' - despite having case notes from 2 other doctors I had met the very same day. I feel that using sectioning as a threat is inappropriate and makes a mockery of the idea that anybody is in a mental health unit 'voluntarily' - it is not voluntary if you are threatened with detainment.  
I asked to leave (as I was there informally) and, after the threatening, was told that I would see a doctor the next day. I felt a lot better. I had time to reflect, plan my abstinence, and put a care package into place for myself with counselling, peer support, recovery meetings all included. This was a lie. I didn't see a doctor the next day. I only found out through my partner who phoned the hospital to find out what was going on that I wouldn't be able to see a doctor that day. I was then told it would be the next day. This left me in 24 hours of sheer anxiety. I'd been told I'd see a doctor but hey, I was told I'd see one a day before, so I had no confidence that I would actually speak to anybody. In the meantime I wasn't allowed out the ward (because I hadn't been seen by a doctor to change my observations) and spent my time watching naff TV. I like a chill day as much as the next person, but more than a few days becomes mind-numbing on this ward. I completed half of the jigsaw puzzles, usually before anybody else had even woken up. I watched the naff TV. I looked out of the window for hours at people waiting for the bus. It is depressing, and honestly, it makes you worse. Finding out your status via your partner making phone calls from the outside makes it feel more like a prison and somewhere where you can't be trusted.  
One of the patients I spoke to had temporarily been in a private hospital due to bed shortages, and they were allocated their own private room. They could sleep better, they had good food, and a much wider variety of things to do. I am not a fan of a privatised healthcare system, but I feel the government needs to invest significant amounts more into mental health services in order to make them effective.  
What I will say is that all of the staff were lovely and doing their best. Every staff member I met was friendly, caring, considerate, and would try and help patients as best they could.  
Sadly I am left firmly of the view that mental health units make people worse, not better.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1019

He has other medical conditions including MS and a pressure ulcer on his back, which myself and my family were concerned would affect his rehab and how long it would take to get him back home. All the staff were brilliant and he was making good progress. Unfortunately he became acutely unwell and had to be admitted to another hospital.  
He was diagnosed with sepsis and the wound deteriorated. There were a couple of times when we thought we would lose him and I thought he would never walk again as he had been in bed for so long, but he pulled through. So after being moved 4 times onto different wards he was finally re-admitted to Castle Ward just before Christmas.  
The whole team from housekeepers, nurses, hcas, physio staff and admin (apologies if I forgot anyone) couldn't have done more to support and care for my Dad. They all contributed to his rehab and for this I am truly grateful. He was confined to his bed because of the wound on his back and on one occasion the staff wheeled his bed down to the Day room, so he could watch the football. They went the extra mile when it was his Birthday in January and allowed us to use the Day room to celebrate with all our family. He went from being hoisted to walking with a frame in a few weeks and put on all the weight he lost when he was unwell. He absolutely loved the food, especially the breakfasts!!  
After 5 months he is finally back home and I would just like to thank all the staff on Castle Ward for their hard work in getting him there. You are all fantastic and I can't thank you enough. Claire (Ward Manager), you have an awesome team. Keep up the good work!!

"ss","Staff","Staff: General","I was arrested a few months ago. This was my first time being arrested, and the experience was terrifying, waiting in a cell with no idea of time passing or what was going on. The first person I saw during that day was a staff member from the Liaison and Diversion service, Joanne, who was on call to assess people being processed. She was very nice, non-judgmental, and did a brief assessment with me to get an idea of my current state. We discussed suicidal thoughts and self harming, and she left me with a lot of sites and agencies to contact, which covered pretty much all eventualities. Though I was still scared, the meeting left me feeling much more stable and reassured, and our discussion helped several things fall into place in my mind that led me to realise that addiction was the core of my problem. That alone was a massive benefit to me, leading me to seek out 12 step groups, but the literature she left also led me on to a pilot group therapy course that has been hugely effective and is still ongoing.  
Joanne herself maintained regular contact with me and my wife, having sessions with me to monitor my mental health and find things to help improve it. She attended child service meetings, worked closely with my wife, and has generally gone above and beyond in assisting us. Having gone through court now, her professional remit to work with me is over, but she is still happy to be there for us if we need her. All in all, I don't know how we would have dealt with this nightmare situation without her help, and the help of everyone at the Service, and we're forever grateful.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1028
"mi","Communication","Amount/clarity of information","I was introduced to the EPEC project at my local children's centre when enquiring about volunteer opportunities. I attended the 10 week training course which consisted of completing the 'Being a parent' course and then being taught to deliver this course to other parents, in a volunteer capacity.  
I found the course fascinating and very useful, learning new strategies and techniques to deal with various issues that arise when caring for children, so that I took more time to think about the reasons behind behaviours and encouraging positive mental health to both children in my care and my own mental state. I also saw ways to use this with other adults in my life plus in day to day situations, defusing potential 'flashpoints' and listening in a more reflective way.  
From this training, I delivered a course with another volunteer to 3 parents. This was over an 8 week period. I found this to be satisfying both personally and to those participating in the course. The feedback received showed that these parents found the course beneficial and they gave examples of how the strategies discussed during the sessions were tried with their children with various degrees of success. The main positive seemed be the parents felt more confident in their parenting abilities and described a calmer, happier home environment.

"cl","Care received","Made A Difference To My Life","I was lucky enough to become involved in a project last year 2018. This was a ten week course I attended at the Summer house children's centre in Sutton in Ashfield.  
The course involved some intensive training over a ten week period. The training was delivered by tutors who work for NCPF. The trainers are assigned by and organisation called EPEC national. The main purpose of the initiative is to teach a group of parent volunteers a package of work in order for these parent group facilitators to group up and go on to teach the 'being a parent' course within their local communities. This stretches over a period of eight to nine weeks.  
The work is specifically to deliver evidence based parenting techniques to a broad range of parents. They learn and put to practice many behavioural strategies and healthy play ideas. They have a chance to reflect on their own childhood in going forward to themselves being 'good enough parents' for their own children. They also learn about managing their own stress levels and explore feelings of guilt when things go not so well . With the feeding in to the course of some self care pointers, positive reassurance from the course facilitators, the participants confidence begins to grow. And by the end of delivery, we see some vast improvements in parenting techniques and happier, more empowered parents heading off on their journeys to bring up into this world children who can play in a free, un-cloistered, none directive way, have a valued voice but to know their fundamental boundaries within the home and in the community.  
On my completion of my training, I went on to co-deliver this course to a group of parents. We had excellent attendance and hands on participation.  
I thoughtfully enjoyed delivering the course and working alongside two fantastic colleges. We helped one another out, worked well as a team. We all bought our own parenting highs and lows to the table in order to make the parents feel that they are not the only ones that have to deal with toddler outbursts or challenging behaviour. And that there is never such thing as a 'perfect parent'.  
In working for this project, I feel on a personal level, I have gained a great deal from the experience of teaching in this style. I would never have thought I would be able to facilitate a course. The confidence I felt from delivering each session doubled each week. It was very life affirming to realise that other parents were actually listening to the evidence based techniques I taught them and going home putting into practice these new strategies. Admittedly some worked for some children, while some had to be tweaked to the individual child and their home circumstances. Having said that, knowing that I could be the one to make changes in the home was truly satisfying. Especially when parents practised poor discipline tactics pre -course.  
Knowing that I could influence positive changes to local families lives made me feel well equipped and able to transfer the skills in to my dream job of being a midwife.  
Last year I failed in my group interview. I was shy, not assertive and let the other competitors over take me.  
So I feel that teaching the being a parent package helped 100% with my recent interviews.  
The general writing on flip charts, communicating with others effectively and taking leadership within a group situation most definitely helped me in my four interviews for university this last month. Most importantly secured me places at three of these universities. My passion for parents and families shone through during interview and I was so much more fiesty and took control this year during the assessed group exercises. I can't thank EPEC enough for helping empowering me, and opening the door to this wonderful opportunity of becoming a student midwife. Thank you so much.

My husband recovered sufficiently to be returned to Lings Bar for convalescence and rehab and so began 8 weeks of care, physio, encouragement and individualised support.  
Small achievements were celebrated, difficulties eased, plans reviewed, measures put in place to ensure that our goals would be met wherever possible and we were involved in it all!

Sometimes they can get it wrong but it is one person usually on the end of the phone and they are limited what they can practically do to help  
Last year I hit a very low point and stood next to the train track. I was 7 steps and 11 minutes away from ending my life. I managed to call the crisis team and fortunately it was someone who knew me really well. She listened and validated how I was feeling. She tried to understand where I was and why. There was no rush, she stayed with me and I felt under no pressure to end the call and also felt held and supported. I was able to trust what she was saying and she didn’t make any threats of calling the police etc but just kept talking to me and calming me down. Eventually we talked through a plan to get away from the train track safely and I knew without a doubt that I could call back at any time.  
I think I called 2 more times that night very distressed and again both times I was listened to and supported to calm down and plan my safety. They knew what had happened earlier and I didn’t have to go over and over the same things - they simply showed that they were listening and wanted to help and keep me safe. Their feedback the next day to my CPN meant that I got the help and support that I needed and although I don’t always like having to be in hospital etc it kept me safe and alive  
A few nights ago I found myself in a dangerous situation at home and again I rang the crisis team. The first action was to get me safe and calm me down and he did this so well and so calmly that I was soon able to take stock of what was happening and how to move forward.

I printed off the information and showed it to my GP. He agreed to refer me as he thinks I have PTSD, caused by a horrendous ordeal in an NHS hospital. The website states if they feel the service is right for you, you’ll hear within 6-8 weeks. Yesterday, when it had been 9 weeks since I saw the GP I called the Centre for Trauma and left a voicemail stating I’d not heard anything. An employee called me back today and said they are no longer accepting new referrals and have not been for some time, as the service may be closing due to funding. She explained they’d written to my GP to tell him this. She said there is another place I can possibly go to that is a part of their trust, but I’d have to be referred all over again.
I am very angry and upset that I have wasted over 2 months for nothing. I have been waiting and waiting for a letter to arrive. Had I not called yesterday, I would never have known. I called my GP surgery. The receptionist said the service had written to them on 13.3.19, so at least they replied fairly quickly, but I think I should have been sent a letter too explaining all of this. My GP is away at the moment, so I have not even been referred to the new place yet. Now the process of trying to get help has to start again and I’m sure it will be months before I hear anything. All I can do in the meantime is keep ringing the Samaritans, but that’s not ideal as it’s a different person every time and I have to explain all my problems and go through the whole story each time.
What I’d like to know is why they did not update their website to say they’re not accepting new patients. That way, had I seen it in back in February I would have known not to waste my time. It has also created more work for my GP, who now has to write another letter to refer me elsewhere. I have reported this matter to CQC.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1081

"dp","Dignity","Involvement: Of Service Users/Patients","Hi, I’m a chathering wheel and access my local adult mental health services via the Stonebridge Centre, City East Team, Nottingham .  
My post is about: Tool Kits for troubles and smiles  
A big thank you to our services (mainly the Recovery College and VoiceBox which is a group for voice hearers), for introducing me to the idea of a tool kit. Especially as no welding, digital or similar skills are involved. Service users, peer persons, and practitioners have all helped me put a box together with a lid on it that says: “Amazing Things Will Happen”. And inside I’ve got stuff so that amazing things do happen. Even on just another mental health day. This is the Tool Kit for troubles and smiles.  
I can now, to a point, get through good, bad, and indifferent days with my kit. I use it everyday/night, sometimes just to browse. I feel stillness; and a connection when I do this. Some stuff makes me laugh, cry, dance. Tool kits can be put together for any and all aspects of life.  
I’ve got cards inside this box with ideas, tips, strategies to get me through alternative thought patterns and loops, voices, and presences, scenarios, and images in my head that sometimes “inner” to me that I’m guilty, useless, rubbish, and other things. Some bewilder me. I’ve got cards with meaningful to me, quotes from books, songs, poems, etc, and things I’ve remembered someone has said to me that was very inspiring or kind. For example I’ve a card with this on it, but laid out differently :  
“Never give up!”  
Then I’ve written who said this to me, where, and vaguely when, below the quote.  
Quite a good find when I'm feeling hurt, broken, that I can’t go on, am passed coping, or on my own with it. I think of that person and the occasion on the card and I hold on to that.  
I have specific cards with specific step by step things to do when I’m too anxious, too sad, too confused, too caught up in a thought, or things, or people, and can’t find a way through. I have cards with plans on them for what to do in a crisis etc. There’s cards as well with how to contact our services/teams, and organisations that can help. So it’s a survival kit sometimes. For example, one step by step card has this on it but laid out differently:  
A thought got your head?  
Find pencil and notebook in this box  
Write this thought out of your head  
Take a break: short - coffee, water, long: the park - leaves against the sky  
Read the thought  
OK? Great. Do something lovely!  
NOT OK? Write a list of all the not oks in your first writing.  
Look at each one: can you do anything about this? Yes: OK. Be lovely.  
No: Leave it in the notebook.  
Now break in. The DVD. CD. Vanilla Tell the stone its story or another story, stones like this.  
OK? Great. Do something lovely!  
NOT OK? Pick another card and do it. Now another. NOT OK? Next: find survival cards, crisis cards, Plan K, H, Y, and C cards, Yes? go , go, go No? Call it a duvet day  
So it’s not all about cards. i’ve got a funny DVD, a CD of fave songs, a stone I painted, vanilla essence, books, poems, photos, letters, a medal, other uplifting, and memorable, special items. And I change the contents so my tool kit remains helpful and inspiring.  
We all put my took kit together, from conversations with each other, bits from the Recovery College and VoiceBox, my research and reading, by chance, and some I just make up. What works stays, what doesn’t goes. Sometimes we help each other with our kits, and practitioners and service users have seen my tool kit and know how I use it. It’s a joint enterprise, but the tool kit is specific to each of us, and each of us makes it in ways we prefer.  
Everyone in my services makes this tool kit happen for me. Thanks to all of you. Please be proud you do this because it’s my treasure trove to prism me through. I hope “Amazing Things Will Happen” for all of you. Tool Kit, or no Tool Kit for troubles and smiles.

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","Eventually was able to persuade other health professionals to contact the OT with a view to getting my terminally ill wife assessed so the carers could get her out of bed. The OT' Karen and Jill duly arrived and gave me advice on how I was getting my wife out/into bed but to my delight they then asked what else I wanted to do which was get her outside in a wheelchair into the garden. They measured and assessed front and back and ordered ramps on my behalf. The ramps duly arrived and I was able to take my wife out into the fresh air and sun but not content with what they had achieved so far they asked my wife what else she really wanted and that was to be able to have a bath - a bath lift was ordered and it meant she was able to have a bath after 3 months. Thanks to Karen and Jill my wife's quality of life has improved by 1000 percent. I have nothing but praise for these two and after the bad publicity for the NHS these are a shining example of what care is all about.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1089
"cf","Care received","Carer support","A close relative was admitted to Rampton almost 2 years ago.  
The first few months at Rampton were not very easy for my relative as they were on an assessment ward and were not able to participate in many activities. I was also struggling to come to terms with the situation and to learn how to handle visits.  
Generally, I am very impressed with the care provided at Rampton. The majority of staff are extremely helpful (from Reception staff to senior management). I have also benefited tremendously from the Carers meetings. It is good to meet with other carers and be able to learn from their experiences. It is also good to offer some encouragement and support to others. I also like the opportunity to meet hospital staff and appreciate the time they give up to join our meetings. Some of the topics covered over the past couple of years have helped me understand how the hospital operates to give patients the best care possible.  
The key issue at the moment seems to be the lack of resources. With the salaries available it seems difficult to fill vacancies, and to retain staff that do take up positions. It is also looks like staff numbers have been reduced as budgets are cut.  
One of the impacts of this is that my relative often has their activities cancelled. To make matters worse this is often done at the last minute. It isn't good for anyone's state of mind to be sitting in the waiting area expecting to go for a swim and then to be told it isn't going to happen. This happens regularly, upsets my relative and frustrates me and staff on the wards. As a minimum, some advance notice should be given out of general courtesy to patients. The staffing issues also need to be addressed.  
Stopping pets being taken in to patient visits was also a bad move in my opinion. I have voiced this on many occasions, and still feel strongly about it. Our dog was assessed as suitable undergoing lengthy assessments by a dog behavioural specialist. She passed with flying colours and then the hospital changed its policy. I still don't know why. I was told that it was to come in line with the other two hospitals, but have since been told that the others do allow dogs to visit. Interestingly, everyone seems to agree that contact with suitable animals is really good for the patients.  
I also think the hospital has a long way to go to introduce more technology for the patients to use. Some of the restrictions in place seem ridiculous. My relative was allowed an mp3 player, but it is so basic you can't choose what music to listen to. I had a better one in 2001, that I used when commuting on the train in to London! In a digital age, patients need to be up to speed with the internet and eCommerce. I fully understand the challenges involved, but a function rich Intranet, with limited access to some Internet content is perfectly possible to provide from a technical perspective.  
Another area that could be improved is where visits are held. It is very difficult to have a natural conversation with my relative when we are in a tiny room with a member of staff sitting in the corner. We need a more comfortable environment to meet in with enough space. On some wards we met in the dining room which was acceptable as it was more like sitting in a cafe, with staff on another table. It would also good to have an outside area for occasional use during the warmer months.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1090
"aa","Access","General","Hi I’m A Catherine Wheel and I access local adult mental health services via the Stonebridge Centre (City East) in Nottingham. Nottingham’s local attractions are attractively listed in article 7000 in Nottingham’s newspapers. Sometimes you can be attracted to the arrow in Robin Hood’s bow, unless some city slickers have got to it first to distract any attraction to our closed for refurbishment castle.  
My tongue in cheek post concerns: locked doors and hot potatoes. Oh yes it does.  
It’s to do with the lack of access to a hot filling to go in my hot potato on account of our locked doors policy. On the Duncan Macmillan site in our Trust I can access Cafe Art for a cold filling in my hot potato without the hindrance of a locked door.  
Hot fillings however come courtesy of Cafe Options a few blocks away from Cafe Art. Alas on the door of Cafe Options is the sign of our Trust - you need to have a code in your head to unlock the door to secure a hot filling for your hot potato. I can access this filling by going all the way back to Cafe Art where I’m to use a free telephone and ask someone with a dreadful code to unlock the door to the Options of hot fillings for hot potatoes.  
Back at Cafe Art there’s a list of telephone numbers, except for Cafe Options. There’s one for Facilities Services (Hotel Services), although I never knew we had a hotel. Still this person might be busy getting rooms ready for the new guests and not have time to sort out hot potatoes. There’s another one for a Flexible Services Manager, and I’ve an appetite for that phone number. I only hope this flexible manager’s office isn’t too far from Cafe Art from whence this flexible manager will have to come, collect me, and take me to my Optional hot filling for my hot potato.  
So much for hot potatoes. Oh no it isn’t.  
I thought I’d spare you a freedom of information request to ascertain the number of locks we have. So here’s my arbitrary approach. I never struck up a deal with an (en)titled person to count the locks at any of our castles. I didn’t ask myself: What specific incident caused each of the doors to have a lock put on it? Is this incident resolved or not? No radio replied: “I’m sorry, I haven’t a clue”.  
For legal reasons, and Trust security, my count reveals:  
7000 or so external locked doors to even gain entry if you are a visitor, service user (with and without an appointment), friend, carer, family, post person, or kissogram  
7000 or so locked doors once inside to access any of the 7000 or so internal corridors  
7000 or so locked doors for every 7000 or so rooms down these so-called 7000 or so corridors  
Locks on all doors THANKFULLY for the unknown number of toilets.  
0000 locked doors if you are a member of staff with a code in your head, or perhaps sub-contracted with a code. I didn’t consider toilets and 0000 locks for staff on this point.  
(My research report is in article 7000 in Nottingham’s newspapers).  
If you’re worried about that code in your head, pharmacists are openly accessible everywhere else. Remember: no codes means no excessive blows of your nose.  
By the way, if you haven’t got a code in your head, Cafe Art serves an excellent hot potato with refrigerated coleslaw. Savour now, before there’s 7001 locked doors.

My post is about Humbling Pie and eating it, at the Stonebridge Centre  
For some time I’ve been chuntering, moanin’ un groanin’ about the reception staff at the Stonebridge Centre and now I take it all back because I have made two visits recently and have been welcomed and looked after with the utmost cheer and helpfulness. So I’m overjoyed to now be eating humble pie despite failing to find the custard app on my laptop.  
A whopping thank you to the staff on reception. You have supplied mugs so I could have some water - twice, spent a great deal of time procuring a prescription that had not been left with you for me to collect, and helped me with some pronunciation queries.  
If this is not enough on both occasions I buzzed the intercom to get in the Centre, and you kindly and encouragingly said to just open the door. This was further topped on both occasions with a welcoming reassuring smile and warm greeting. This had a very positive affect on me as on both occasions I was quite anxious. The latter time because I was seeing a psychiatrist I had never met before and felt worried and tense about this. You put me so much at ease that the consultation started well and progressed even better. I think you enabled the tone of that consultation to be set so that I could benefit a great deal from the appointment. Thank you so much.  
I feel warm inside writing this post. It brings to mind those old school days in the Netherlands recalled in the song I can’t remember. That occasion…..  
I ate humble pie  
When I was in Reception  
I thought you’d never change

Humble Pie’s just my dessert  
You’re surely ace  
Now I see us all in sweetness and light  
I have to say  
i was oh so wrong  
And I’ve learnt something else now, that's right  
I am just amazed  
At your warm welcome  
Makes me want to come

"cm","Care received","Medication ","Following an 8 week stay on ward B2 I felt thoroughly ready to commit suicide. Having been admitted with a psychosis due to lack of slept I left feeling dejected, degraded and utterly depressed. I felt that staff were corrupt and offered patients extra cigarette breaks in exchange for dishonourable 'favours'.  
I went without medication frequently as it 'wasn't ordered' whilst on another occasion was given antipsychotic medication I was not prescribed. Fortunately I spotted the mistake, whether deliberate or not, and it had to be recorded as a drug error. I was given a depot injection so high in my gluteus it hit the nerves in my lower back muscles giving me pain for 4 days on lying down. Nutrition came in the form of aeroplane style tray food in a segregated dining room with meals on wheels.  
There is no social inclusion and when I asked to go to the hospital canteen where all the staff and 'physical' patients and carers go I was told by canteen staff I could but not to 'disturb' the general public.  
Confidentiality is non-existent on the ward and I frequently heard staff discussing other patient's business with other patients or in front of other patients. There was violence, a complete disregard for how women might feel on a mixed ward with nowhere to go away from the men (men were allowed to use the only ladies lounge). Staff mocked patients openly whilst bragging about their credentials as forensic mental health workers.  
I felt this was a trip to the dark ages of mental health care and one I don't wish to repeat. I'd give recommendations to improve this unit but the only conclusion I can draw based on my experience is to shut it down and use other facilities.","-5","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1113

At that time I was seen by an Assistant Practitioner within the team for 6 month review, this was a more positive experience.  
The member of staff, Joanna was cheerful, positive and focused on my recovery needs. She made me laugh and was a breath of fresh air. This was very needed at that time. Good information was given and the referral to the living well service was very beneficial.

"mm","Communication","Communication","I originally was given the details for Let’s Talk by my doctor as an idea for half-way help before I came to the front of the waiting list for DBT.  
By time I got to the front of their waiting list, I had complete my DBT (I waited years, even after they were contacted several times by my doctor and the crisis team to push my application further), as I was deemed a ‘low risk’ even though I couldn’t leave my bed for a year and a half without going into a major breakdown.  
When I FINALLY got a place, I had 2 sessions before my counsellor was off sick every Wednesday- rearranging my sessions for the next week, or week after without giving me notification of this until I turned up; and then got a letter in the post regarding a session I usually had no idea about. I openly told this person I couldn’t do the times being offered on the Wednesday, and it would have to be after 3:30pm- but this person clearly had other ideas and kept booking me in for earlier so I couldn’t attend the rare time they did show up. I was given the chance for a session maybe once a month, which was cancelled usually, despite being told I would have a 6-8 week program of weekly sessions.  
They never offered an alternative to the therapist I was given, despite asking multiple times due to them constantly being off sick.  
I lost out on money by booking myself a slot on the days I was supposed to have the counselling instead of fitting more work in. Being self-employed, a £12-£30 loss of money per week only to be cancelled on is a lot of money to drop from your wages.  
I have now been discharged from the services due to ‘not attending 3 sessions’. I only did not attend one session where the counsellor did not ring me to say they were sick; and I rang in for this as I myself was ill.  
Very disappointed in the service. It’s no wonder rates of issues relating to mental health are going up when the help I can get is this bad.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1121

"ap","Access","Provision of services","I have three children and a very busy life. I wanted to give breastfeeding a go after being educated on the health benefits through anti- natal classes.  
My first baby had issues with breastfeeding because of his tongue but I did not access much support, as I was more unaware of it and stressed with our struggles. We breastfed for 13 very stressful and lonely weeks.My 2nd had issues breastfeeding in that she was jaundice and too sleepy to feed. We were readmitted to hospital where the Drs gave me advice regarding bottle feeding. Luckily I had received a text message from the breastfeeding support team just as I had left hospital. I called them from the children's ward and they made me a feeding plan, visited me regularly and gave me groups to attend. Within days my daughter was gaining weight rapidly and breastfed for a year. Horrifyingly, the funding was soon removed for breastfeeding supporters to visit mother's in their homes. My 3rd baby was happy to feed but I had damage to my nipples from my past 2 experiences. I managed to make my way to a group and the breastfeeding supporters showed me how to do things differently, and how to heal myself, and I am still feeding my baby now. I could NOT have breastfed my babies without these groups. Baring in mind that this is the recommended way to feed babies from the WHO and the NHS, this support is absolutely vital for breastfeeding to succeed in many cases.  
I regularly access the group's now for support during certain stages, and for medical help. It is a lifeline when breastfeeding a baby.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1141
"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","Why oh why do I find myself complaining here again about the very same service. A service that is supposed to help me and others when most distressed and vulnerable and which has once again I feel, let me down spectacularly.  
I spoke to out of hours line on a Thursday and spoke to a staff member who was so compassionate and kind and really saved my life when I was adamant on taking it. Following this I was persuaded by both my cpn and psychologist to be officially re-referred to the team for support. I had my reservations as I have felt let down by this service in the past, and sometimes felt accessing this service has actually made me feel more suicidal, but I am always optimistic, so agreed.  
I spoke to the same staff member again on the next evening again this staff member was amazing in their effort to help. I got through another shaky night. This staff member explained they would put me down for daily contact over weekend.  
On the following day, I spoke to a different member of staff who I've spoke to on many occasions and who also I believe really did their best to help me. This staff member wanted me to see someone on the next day face to face. But I am currently hearing voices that will not allow this and so after persuasion I agreed with this staff member that they could ring me after 4pm the next day and I would have telephone support. They also offered me a Fp10 for prn medication and told me to ring if I needed it as I initially declined.  
The call was arranged for the following day as although I could ring if I needed to. a) the voice and my distress make it difficult for me to be able to pick up the phone. b) I find it difficult to go through everything once again with someone new and it is better for a staff member to ring me so that that person can read my notes first and know where I'm at c) For personal but justifiable reasons I find it difficult to speak to male workers & wouldn’t know if a female would be available.  
So the next day was extremely difficult very early on. I rang in the morning and asked if an Fp10 for prn medication could be written as I felt I would not be able to get through without it. When the same staff member from the previous day came on shift they rang me to say it would be written and posted through my door and at this point never went any further to ask how I was, just told me I would be rung later that day as planned.  
I wanted to ring the team all day but didn’t for the reasons I mentioned above and waited for my call. I received no call. By the evening time I was very distressed as I know daytime shift would soon be finishing but I presumed the service was very busy and I would be called before end of shift.  
By later that evening, after receiving no call, I once again felt let down and that I had been promised things which were not delivered.  
Eventually I found the strength to ring the service in the hope I could speak to a female worker or at least get an explanation about what went wrong.  
I spoke with a different member of staff. I asked to speak to the nurse on shift and rather than pass me over they wanted to know why I wanted to speak to the nurse. So I explained I was upset as I was expecting a call. They asked me what I actually wanted a call for, and when I said for telephone support they again asked what for exactly? They then went on to tell me it's my responsibility to ring if I need to speak to someone and not the crisis team no matter what was promised. I got upset at this because 1. what is the point in being re-referred at all if that was the case as I can ring you anyway as I'm under secondary services and 2. I was promised a call and not once did I receive an apologise or explanation.  
I asked to speak to a different nurse on shift and they did apologise however said I had already had a call that day and the staff member probably thought that was enough and didn’t require a further call.  
I feel that half of my admissions over the years could have been avoided if someone just came and listened when this was arranged.  
I would like an explanation on what went wrong on this occasion once again. Please provide here if possible.

"ti","Transition/coordination","Coordination/Integration Of Care","I am the SENCo at a city school where engaging parents can be difficult at times as lots of our parents have English as a second language and lead very busy lives.  
I have recently referred two children who need additional support in our school through the official routes, which as you know, takes a lot of time and effort from many members of staff.  
The first child's mum has pulled away from support despite still struggling daily to meet her child's needs. Mum felt uncomfortable about having a SLT therapist in her house when she is not confident with her English. I had mentioned on the form that mum wasn't confident with her English and would need a translator, however the initial phone call was made in English and it wasn't mentioned that they would have a translator would be present. When I phoned through to speak about this the only answer was...mum can phone back and tell us shes changed her mind- a solution that still doesn't address mum's lack of confidence with English.  
The second child's parent did engage and arrived for her meeting this morning, she waited for 10 minutes, after walking in the rain, and I phoned through to ask whether the appointment was going ahead. The person on the phone was very helpful and told me she would phone the Speech and Language Therapist for us to ask what was happening. We waited for a further 10 minutes to be told she was off sick, again the person on the phone was very apologetic. Mum had already rearranged work and set off in the rain to tell work she would be late again in a few weeks.  
I really feel that communication with mum should have been made by the SLT team at the earlier possible opportunity, so that we won't have another parent who is put off by the whole process and I shouldn't be asked to pass on apologies on your behalf.  
I hope that changes in the way the system communicates with parents can be altered to support schools and parents.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1158

This is the hot topic of the day.  
I had a meal in Cafe Options today where the hot stuff is. This cafe is based at Duncan MacMillan house where a locked doors policy reigns meaning I'm not in with a chance of the hot stuff . Cold food is unlocked in the lovely Cafe Art though.  
Apologies to the now worried member of staff in Cafe Art who I unwittingly caused to be concerned by telling her I was just a person, instead of saying I was a service user. I do think that made it harder for her as she must have thought I'd arbitrarily turned up with no ""legitimacy"". I did the wrong thing and asked her if she could take me to Cafe Options for hot food, which she couldn't do. She did make good suggestions about showing Id etc and did say that she couldn't give me the door code. I didn't ask for this and am so glad she couldn't reveal the code as I'd never have remembered it. So your security approaches are being adhered to and the member of staff at Cafe Art was very polite and tried her best. I'm sorry I put her off by forgetting the service user bit.  
Well, those Flexible Services persons who I appealed to were equally wonderful. I knew Flexible Services would be the correct phone number to dial following the instructions on the door of Cafe Options to phone someone in order to gain access if you didn't have a code in your head. Yes. An excellent choice. And an excellent flexible escort service. Even taken to the corridor where I only had a few steps to walk to hot food's end. Thanks too to this wonderful flexible person for not remarking on how I looked as though I'd just come out of the shower, and for not letting on, even if you did guess, that all was not entirely"" fine, thank you"", today. Just what my version of a doctor would have ordered.  
So I hope the flexible services team will continue to be the escort service for admission to Cafe Options. You really are good at it. And thanks.

The last two admissions have been under male mental illness it has been very challenging internally + externally to say the least but I have managed to be resilient and persevere despite the vulnerable state I was in and the challenges I have faced.

They wasn't impulsive with knee jerk reactions and never took a punitive stance as this stance can have a long term, damaging and detrimental impact on the patient psychologically and emotionally, which can impact on the therapeutic working relationships with the team or with individuals deemed to be in positions of authority who could potentially work with the patient on their road to recovery on their future pathway.

I'm had a lot of health issues lately and the healthcare team was really helpful in booking hospital appointments and in fact pushing so I received my hospital appointments quicker than normal, and aftercare when you're released from hospital and return back to the prison is fantastic following care concerns and making sure you're ok.  
Also I pick up my prescribed tablets monthly and some weekly - they are always on time, occasionally they have been short or the doctor has prescribed me something.

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","My father is immobile and has advanced dementia with behaviours that became increasingly challenging, culminating in him having to move from a care home to a Nursing home in August 2018. Prior to his move, in an attempt to enable him to remain in the care home, the County dementia outreach team were contacted.  
The input received from ALL members of the team was excellent. They spent many hours getting to know my father and liaising with both care home staff and family , offering suggestions to help manage the behaviours that challenge. Unfortunately he was unable to stay in the care home and as the placement broke down they offered suggestions of homes that could manage my fathers illness as it progressed . When he moved into a nursing home they continued to offer support to my father, the home and our family. This made the transition easier and the inevitability of his dementia progressing easier knowing we had ongoing support from a positive team and a friendly, knowledgeable group of professionals at the end of a phone. There should be more teams like this. A very positive experience during a difficult time. We felt totally involved in decisions about my fathers care.Special thanks to Karen, Emma, Jane and the rest of the team

"aa","Access","General","I was sectioned last year after Manor Road twice told me that I was not ill enough to access their service over an 8 year period. I was fobbed off yet again as I have an alcohol problem which I am addressing with success. (which is not taken on board by Manor Road), but has always been recognised by CGL new directions. . I have an alcohol outreach worker at CGL New Directions who introduced me to a consultant psychiatrist. This psychiatrist referred me to the Mandala Centre as he saw signs of Borderline personality disorder.  
The Mandala Centre referal was not accepted as it was missing essential details about my ongoing mental health difficulties and medication. They instead wanted to refer me to a step 4 dealing with emotions course. I was then told this course no longer runs.  
During the referral process my health deteriorated and I was referred to Manor Road local mental health team.  
The Nurse at Manor Road, contrary to the information given, told me that I did not have borderline personality disorder and was not bad enough. I am a patient of psychiatric services for 27 years and have accessed the Mandala Centre on and off during this time. I had also been sectioned on a 136 in 2012.  
During this time I visited my GP in desperate need of help. The GP was reluctant to re- refer me back to mental health services as in their words the referal would only get 'bounced back' it took my partner's insistance on trying once again for this to happen.  
I would like to stress that without CGL input, both with my alcohol outreach worker and the psychiatrist who works alongside, a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder may have never been made or at the very least may have resulted in many more years of unnecessary suffering. This not only affects me but has had a knock on effect for all areas of life. I was effectively left alone to cope, which was a life of not coping.  
Somebody at Manor Road called me some weeks after assessment ( they did not tell me who they were) and I was told over the phone that I would not be seen as I needed to sort the alcohol issue out first. They had already been told that alcohol use was a secondary concern to my mental health condition and that I was engaging with CGL services.  
This led to a feeling of horror of which I was certain I would not recover from.  
I then tried to take my own life and was sectioned. A second form was submitted to the Mandala Centre by CGL. I would like to say that staff at CGL assured me that they would not give up on getting me appropriate help and treatment.  
I was then assessed by the Mandala Centre and was found to have borderline personality disorder. I am now due to enter their Mentalisation based therapy programme in September. I am very pleased that I have been accepted onto this and that Mandala Centre have recognised that I had an underlying additional mental health condition which needed treating.  
I am going to make a complaint to Manor Road. It has become apparent that local mental health teams and GP's are not aware of what Mandala Centre actually does, even after being invited to open events providing information on services regarding personality disorder and what therapy they offer. Surely this would be helpful in their assessment of people that come into their care.  
There is an obvious misalignment between alcohol services and mental health services. This was once addressed through the duel diagnosis service which only closed down last year and I knew nothing about until I researched it myself. This service existed because it is well know that substance misuse and mental health issues often go hand in hand. I feel that to deny this puts vulnerable people at risk.  
It is not good enough to blame people with mental heath problems when you have asked for help and there is no one there.  
I am saying this because I nearly lost my life.

"cc","Care received","Care received","My wife has been at crisis for a approx 2 months and is known to mh services for several years. Around a month ago she was reffered to your team following serious suicidal ideation and in fact action. This was considered necessary by 2 nurses from her lmht and she did at this point accept she needed help.
crisis team held a mdt led by your new doctor and refused to support my wife and made the incredible decision she wasnt in crisis at all despite her being the lowest I've ever seen her in 10 years. luckily my wife got a cancellation with her own psychiatrist who seeing how unwell she was and also supported by higher up management referred her immediately again to you.
This time there was actually a competent doctor on who knows my wife well and accepted her for support without question
Unfortunately my wife had lost trust in  your team at this point and felt like you didnt actually want to work with her. The doctor who knew her saw her and persisted and was amazing in not only making her feel she did in  fact need support but also arranging for that support to be in a manner that would work best I.e same nurses etc. He assured my wife the team who had many times got it wrong  with her in the past would make change and errors would not be repeated.
My wife mood seemed  to pick up but not in a good way, she started to believe she might be invincible she refused medication because of this. I was concerned about this but crisis team discharged her after being under them a few weeks regardless definitely prematurely a.
2 days later she was picked up by police In our local park in the midst of a serious suicidal act, she had gone not to die but to prove that by doing something deadly and surving she was indeed invincible. I took time.off work to watch her continuously and sought help of gp who felt she needed urgent and intensive help but I didnt sant hospital for her. She saw her psychiatrist once again the next day who persuaded her to accept daily crisis team visits to re-engage with her medication as the only alternative to hospital.

My wife didnt want to go but I told her that her psychiatrist had set the plan up and everyone wanted to help. She went and was there 1.45mins. When she came back she was extremely distressed. She told me that this new doctor had gone through the last 10 years of being unwell and questioned everything and then told her to sort out her life as no medication was ever going to help. subsequently my wife now believes she doeant have an illness and wont take medication putting her at extreme risk despite  having diagnosis 10 years and myself and her lmht knowing medication has been crucial and life saving in the past.

"ce","Care received","Emotional care","My first thought reflecting on the care I experienced at The Recovery College was the teams encouragement towards a healthy freedom of expression; thoughts I had found restricting were given the opportunity to be shared and explored in an environment that felt communal and safe. When I googled ‘freedom of expression’ it was defined as ‘reinforcing all other human rights, allowing society to develop and progress.’ That ‘The ability to express our opinion and speak freely is essential to bring about change in society’, this fits well with my personal experience of The College’s approach towards care- by revolutionising traditional thought and stigma it facilitates a strength based ability. This is further supported by the appropriate principals and ethics that should surround mental health in securing a safe environment. I realised how in practice this can be valuable not only to the individual, but also enabling a better understanding from and to others. Everyone appears valued at the Recovery College, everyone learns from experience and everyone has a responsibility of care.  
The responsibility one has as a student there is one of respect, for yourself, fellow students and those that are providing the service, this works well in instilling self autonomy and boundaries and it doesn’t come at the expense of your own freedom of choice. Attendance is monitored but exceptional circumstances permissible. A scale of 1-10 is given on sharing personal experiences in the class, 2 being considered safe to share and the option to pass at any point on feeding back. From the toe dipping sessions such as building self- esteem or self confidence to the more immersive sessions on co-producing a course or ratification all are interactive, progressive and balanced with careful thought towards content and structure.  
Many of the things that had affected my mental health had developed from being in positions that didn’t fully align with my own personal value system that resulted in an internal friction. Mid way through my first term I was so inspired by what I was experiencing at The College and changes within that I decided to explore healthcare academically with a view to a possible career change. Helen who runs the college generously gave up an hour of her time which proved invaluable to me. On a white board she illustrated in a manageable, digestible illustration the different occupational facets that make up the healthcare system in the UK and areas that may suit me best. This led to my enrolling with The Open University to study for a Higher Diploma in Adult Health and Social Care in conjunction with my time at The College and volunteering as an advocate.  
The Recovery College literally enabled me to turn my life around. I moved to Nottingham from the South due to ill health and needing support. In a few weeks time I graduate and I have recently secured a job as a Peer Support Worker. I’m now in a position to be reunited with my daughters and put literally ‘everything’ I have learnt to good use. On the front of their prospectus can be found the words, hope, control and opportunity.

"wb","Access","Time spent waiting between appointments","Hi, I'm A Catherine Wheel and access adult local mental health services in Nottingham, City East, via the Stonebridge Centre.  
Remember Remember the 5th of November: Please Plan- Et With Care  
This post concerns care plans. As A Catherine Wheel these plans are intended to light up the night sky in a Tropical Storm, follow the firework code, and ensure my return on a Silver Cloud to Burning Bush with the lead professional who Astra-nomically manages my care. My bonfire is piled high on a Standard care pathway, so the consultant psychiatrist is privileged, (sic(k), probably), to be my leading pro.Please spare a thought for this consultant, Dr Fawkes. Fireworks come with government warnings about taking care, and how lighting up can seriously damage your health. And this is without the mission impossible of giving Dr Fawkes two distinct jobs to do in one consultation. To be a psychiatrist, or not to be a care manager, that is the issue. If the cap fits and all that. But no wonder Dr Fawkes seems worn out having to frequently exchange two stylish hats like that during the brief lives of one appointment. The other hazards we two Shooting Stars must face include:1. When we consult in our Mystic Cone at the Stonebridge Centre, Dr Fawkes considers my considerable flare under the psychiatrist’s hat. When the hurly-burly’s done Dr Fawkes makes a decision of 17 weeks, 6, 9, 12 month's time, for when we two shall meet again. How long, how long does my care plan last? Where oh where did the other hat go? Lost to A Thunder Clap in Golden Rain. 2. A Firefly on a Whistle Stop told me that the list at the end of my gp letter is my “care” “plan”. Didn’t the Institute of Mental Health research Care Plans a few years ago? Could have got lost in that Snow Storm on Mount Vesuvius I suppose.3.Don’t try this at home, but have you ever got hold of Dr Fawkes in between the appointments? Jumping Jacks and Jumping Jills doesn’t come into it. As A Catherine Wheel I can get stuck mid-spin, despite my best fizz fizzles. Left sooo looong with this care plan, even my Olympic Torch, and that Mighty Atom hitting the Jackpot might not suffice. Oh Dr Fawkes, unbelievable as this might Rocket for you, sometimes I just want to say: hello, Harlequin. Regrettably even that Super Sonic Bang of Halley’s Comet doesn't get me that earlier appointment with you.4.If any Smasher out there has phoned and been put through to Dr Fawkes directly, tell me how you did this, in Dragon’s Fire on a post card, please.5. There’s things you need to know about psychiatrists. Their local knowledge and networking is for other purposes, and they don’t get out the Mystic Cone much. It’s the Trust’s fault, underneath their Floodlight, beside the Standard Traffic Light. How can the Trust expect psychiatrists to help with saucing Golden Fountains, Roman Candles, and bonfire locations for me to lighten up the social inclusion, if our Trust confines its Dr Fawkeses like this? And it’s a Boomer of a Screecher for A Catherine Wheel to have to meet in a tiny clinical setting to plan a care full roasting. I long to meet Dr Fawkes in one of those costing a lotta cafes to Cannon the plan. I’d stomp up for the skinniest of refreshment to share a Chrysanthemum Fountain and Crackers served on a Flying Saucer with my leading pro. 6. Well, there’s a plan. I’ve gone according to plan (imaginatively). Now we need to review this plan. Please re-read the above. My fuse is running short.7. I’m not sure Dr Fawkes, if you like me DIYing my care plans. And I know they are threadbare without you. Ages ago I found out my leading pro could also be a cpn, or social worker. Dr Fawkes, why didn’t you tell me? Didn’t you want me to make a Highball choice? Doesn’t seem right, you know, for you to have been given these two hatted hazards, and for both of us to undertake missions impossible. Still, would be great though if we could spend time on these plans, teamwork together, share the stories, and remember remember the 5th of November. Plan et with care.8. You know what, I’m going to ask the Trust to think about this. Meanwhile Dr Fawkes, I reckon we’ve earned some Golden Delight, don’t you?

I am appalled that nothing has been done to tackle the root cause of these problems. It seems like desperate people are trying to use reviews as a means to get responses to urgent requests and needs that are not happening when and where they should. I urge the 'NHS website ratings and reviews' to be less harsh and allow the publication of honest and courageous comments/reviews that aim to improve the services being provided to all, and increase transparency.

My son particularly enjoys the outdoor mowing and role play at house, building and being in the kitchen (ironing) and using the tools done jobs.  
The sessions have been fantastic to encourage my son who is quiet and really bring out his confidence. He is never worried or anxious to come into sessions (which he struggles with at nursery) and is always the last to leave. He loves the snack time. He doesn't engage much with singing but he listens and it has helped him to withstand structure and discipline as he starts his school life in september.

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","My Story  
I suffered stroke some 19 weeks ago, (just over 4 months ago). At first I thought I was ok but after 4 weeks and half days hospital, I had had enough of it all and was ready to come home.  
At first I felt ok, but the stroke had a strange effect. I realised I hadn't been able to get down to thinking about it and still find it difficult to do so. I had become sort of muted about life and didn't say much, but then after a week back at Church I took my singing into my hands and went for it. Thank God I did because I wouldn't have made much obvious improvement had I not done this. I went back a week before Easter, some 5 weeks following my stroke and I have been to Church every single occasion since. (thought I would mention that, as it is important to me) I have been singing in Church choirs over 60 years.  
I began work with the Nursing Team by way of an interview with Shelley within 1 week of my initial diagnosis saw Roanne (OT) a week later and was able to see Margaret, my speech Therapist a couple of weeks thereafter. I was able to see 3 Therapists for 3 weeks until Roanne was admitted to hospital for booked surgery. (Is she recovering and indeed recovered well enough to return to her full-time duty? I wish her well whatever).  
Her replacement was Rhea who was an OT. I got on well with all the Stroke Team nurses I saw over the next 3 months who helped me make enough progress to bid them farewell. I do not think I would have improved to the extent I have done, had I not seen these 4 Nurses. I shall be forever grateful to them.  
I still don't feel well - that is, the same as I was before my stroke and I find that frustrating. However, I realise that it is going to take me longer to recover than I had thought.  
_My partner's thoughts on my improvement:_  
My partner was very keen that I should add something to his story under the above heading. So firstly echo his gratitude to all the four therapists he has mentioned. Their incredibly prompt support, their expertise and advice combined with their friendliness contributed much, I am sure, to my partner's undoubted progress.  
I am also impressed that notwithstanding their work with my partner has ended, he is to be reviewed not only six months, but also twelve months from the date of his stroke. I was finally further impressed when he was referred to specialists in the team other than those mentioned, namely Posy and Gavin (forgive me if I have miss recalled his name) being psychologist and physiotherapist respectively to ensure that no aspect of my partner's health was not considered.  
Despite the fact that he still feels, to use his words' unwell' and acknowledging that of course he is still struggles on occasion to do things as he used to, he continues to improve and in my heart (inexpert) opinion, has made enormous progress in what is still relatively a short period of time. I am confident, as always have been, that he will continue to recover and improve over time.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1245

This is my second time trying to refer myself to this place, about a month after I filled the form they send a letter saying I've been discharged back to my GP. It says in the letter that they'd sent me another letter and tried to ring me. I never got the letter and I don't recall receiving a missed call. About this time last year was the first time I referred myself. It took six months just to get a phone consultation! By that time my mental health got so bad they said they couldn't help me and sent me to crisis team. The horror that was the crisis team is another story. The moment I felt myself slipping again I referred myself to this service a second time but I'm right back to square one again and - since crisis team kept none of their promises - I guess I'll just have to deal with it on my own, yet again. So yeah, this is a review of the referral system rather than the service itself, as I've yet to actually get anything out of the service. Just referring yourself in the first place can be a big step and then to have it thrown back in your face makes you feel like you're not worth anything.
Although, seeing all the one star reviews on here makes me glad I haven't been accepted, I'm just sad that I have no other option but to wait until I need the crisis team again, all other options have to be paid for or have two year waiting list.

Given that the people ringing them will be feeling distressed, possibly suicide, in a lot of emotional pain, there isn’t a lot of understanding that we may be finding it difficult to find the words we need. A little bit of patience and gentleness can make all the difference. I have now had two encounters with staff who are so pushy and rude and have no concept of how difficult it is and how much courage it has needed to ring up. I suffer from social anxiety and will go to extreme lengths to avoid making phone calls. To be met with the impatience of some of the staff makes me think they need training in how to talk to people in distress.  
Some of the team both at Bassetlaw and Mansfield have been just what I needed. They’ve spoken to me respectfully and gently, with kindness and great understanding. Why can’t all the Crisis team members be as helpful as them?

Some Patients feel different in many ways but we are not all the same are we. to be more responsive you could relax the ward rules as much as possible.

Then the last year every sat am/ pm. I am usually the only visitor on the ward although there have been times other visitors have visited the same time as me. It's never been a problem before but now I am told this has changed. I can only visit am or pm and my partner is only allowed one visit per weekend, so if my partner's relatives visit him on a Saturday I am not allowed now to visit him on a Sunday. Nobody is saying why this has changed and who this has come from. Duty social worker didn't know anything about this, security staff I've spoken to aren't aware, ward staff are saying they just received and email from their ward manager, so where's this come from? What's the point in having visiting hours when your not allowed to visit?? This impacts on depriving the patient from a positive experience to help ease their confinement in that awful place, and deprives me from the pleasure of seeing my partner. When I ask questions about any new changes or restrictions put in place regarding my partner staff never tell me why even though my partner has given me permission to be kept informed about all aspects of the care received. Overall my experience of the hospital has been negative, I as a visitor have seen and heard unprofessional conduct towards my partner and also I  myself have been treated with no respect . I understand there's aspects of the work that can be difficult and not all the staff are unhelpful but I have been shocked and upset many times as to how myself and my partner have been treated. The visiting hours should not be restricted it's the only highlight of our week and it's unfair to take this away. The hospital needs to 
uphold them. And if I book to visit am on a particular weekend day if there's no other visitors in the afternoon why can't I visit pm as well like I have always done??

The HCA's and nurses are all incredibly compassionate and will go above and beyond to help you when you are struggling no matter what time of day it is and regardless of how busy they are. Compared to other wards I have been on, the staff on B2 are truly amazing.  
My issue however is not with the ward staff at all. But with how I was treated by psychiatry the whole time I was on the ward. Firstly, they were not compassionate in my opinion. I felt they did not make any effort to get to know me as a person and made their own assumptions about the kind of person I am just by reading my notes. Every ward round felt rushed. They spoke so quickly, talked over me, did not listen to what I had to say and then ended it just as abruptly as it started. This made me feel incredibly invalidated.After not even a week on the ward, I felt pushed to go home despite me mentioning numerous times about my intentions to harm myself/end my life. I felt like they completely washed their hands of me the minute they read 'personality disorder' on my paperwork. Because of my PD diagnosis I felt instantly branded as untreatable with medication, and told there was nothing they could do to help. I have diagnosis of Depression, GAD and PTSD too but all of those were disregarded and I was discharged before I felt ready and whilst I was still actively making plans to end my life.  
It is such a shame it was like this because it made me resent the entire ward towards the end. It made me paranoid that all of the staff thought I was wasting a bed.

The staff are caring and I am treated well. You could improve on this with the new starters, disruption on the wards – the staff doesn’t stay.

Being effective. Talk a lot and say nothing. The Psychologists said they guess what people are thinking kind of sort of and use their hands. They're Pacifists, terribly pleasant with all of that though. I suppose that’s what they're taught in university. Not an exact science, this mental health.  
Stop trying to get me to jump through hoops on fire before I can move on. Get me a captain’s cap then I could advertise. We are given our meals on a plate the meals are regular we are very lucky like that, we have clean bedding our own rooms not like years ago ( dormitories). The female Patients don’t mix with Male Patients ..why not.  
I think the Staff hear what they want to hear. I get on better with some staff than others, depends on age group and what time zone we are in. The Staff spend too much time writing up notes and recording negative incidents that don’t really natter.  
Patients appear to be judged on what comes out of their mouths. Many Patients have the gift of the gab and could talk hind legs off a Donkey, not by what a person actually does.

"sl","Staff","Staffing levels","I am a Patient on Hambleton Ward. Re staffing and feeling safe, No I don’t always feel safe. I felt unsafe, and threatened by other patients and there were not enough staff available and I think the IR1’s are not always filled in. I think a variety of information could be given by staff and Patients at the community meeting. They would feel safer, accepting there is a staff shortage Patients have to work with Staff. this is not put in Patients reports. Needs to be put in records so it is acknowledged It is a ripple effect throughout. I think that it makes patients feel unsettled. Give Patient recognition when they work with staff.  
My ward round is becoming more consistent. Involvement in it is a different issue. My experience is that they feedback but don’t actively listen. Decisions are made without the Patient being involved. The team could support us more to ensure we feel included. Based on community meetings it was said that Patients should be involved and listened to, you need to put this into action. Feeling cared for, Have a long term condition- now being listened to and can self-medicate, working with nursing team to move forward. This is positive.  
Recently I did not feel cared for I was feeling anxious and vulnerable, self-harming, did not receive any assistance that day. Felt ignored and damaged, it took nice staff to resolve the situation. As a Patient I was not feeling any faith in the system. I only sometimes feel heard when in a crisis because of self-harm. To help feel listened to I want to feel welcome- stop invalidating me.

"ss","Staff","Staff: General","Hi I’m A Catherine Wheel a former patient who accessed adult mental health services via the Stonebridge Centre, (City East) Nottingham. I’ve recently wizzed off to Yorkshire.  
Here’s my last spin before I go out with a fizz fizz fizzle  
Well, I can’t say we have always seen eye to eye during my patienthood here. Still you have given me the opportunity to share some of my views via Care Opinion which I have valued highly. I have noticed that posts on Care Opinion do get a response, and I hope that these responses will result in positive action in the future.  
There is considerable potential here to have a set up that offers timely, relevant, responses to need, that are the best. This is evidenced in VoiceBox - a group for voice hearers, and in the Recovery College which does offer outstanding first level short courses.  
Perhaps policies like locked doors, restricted access to the Recovery College, too much emphasis on danger, risk, crisis could be considered to make for more positivity one day. I know that change can happen here. It did at the Stonebridge Centre where the Reception staff now allow patients to enter without patient’s justifying why they have come. Stonebridge is now a pleasanter place to enter. There is clearly a willingness, and I hope this can be built on.  
I am hopeful that one day patient’s will become service users here. I am hopeful that one day there will be profound changes and something quite else will replace psychiatry, and services as we currently know them.  
Yes, I’m a dreamer and I’m going to do what I can to help make the world work for everyone. For everyone to have a decent life. Yes, I’m all fizzled out as A Catherine Wheel. You have spun me this far. Fired up my enthusiasm to help make changes. I’ve learned a lot here. Mainly by my mistakes. Thanks for letting me make mistakes.

Last week I commended the gym team for their support during the marathon.... This week I was told I'm too fit to attend the gym sessions that I have been attending since arriving at the hospital and most significantly they said that sometimes I am the only patient that attends so it is not a good use of their staff and it makes their statistics look bad!! We are in a hospital and not everyone is mentally well enough to attend sessions all of the time. They did however offer me alternative gym sessions in the main hospital but I am unable to attend these due to my mental health, if it was that simple then I would be cured and would no longer require the services of this hospital, but I am far from cured, I am at the start of my Treatment and the trust I did have has now been lost and I am now left confused and disheartened. They tell us that they support our individual care needs but clearly they do not know me at all. The majority of the patients in this hospital are classed as overweight, if they have received the same lack of compassion as I feel that I have this week then I'm not surprised they dont want to attend the gym. This week we received a letter from the chief executive informing us that the CQC has classed the hospital as inadequate.

"ti","Transition/coordination","Coordination/Integration Of Care","I have recently seen a Speech & Language Therapist with my 13 year old daughter. On speaking to Nicola, she asked if I could share my views on our experience and care received.  
My daughter has struggled many years with anxiety and upset stomach/sickness, we have always reported our concerns to our GP. I asked numerous times if CAMHS would be an option to help her and I was initially told by a GP that she did not fit the criteria and you would have to be self harming to be seen (said in front of my child). Obviously this horrified me as I was trying to get help for my daughter so it wouldn't escalate to this. They offered anxiety counselling August 2018 at our local health centre of which we attended 3 appointments. Unfortunately my daughter felt the sessions were no help and she told the counsellor what she wanted to hear so she could get discharged. My daughter at the time did not believe she suffered with anxiety and was adamant she was poorly.  
After numerous visits to our GP as my daughters symptoms were severely affecting her school attendance we were finally referred to a Community Peadiatrician, who thankfully listened and referred us to CAMHS and requested an ASD assessment.  
We have seen a mental health practitioner a few times now and she is currently trying to get my daughter some CBT therapy, as she believes this will help with her anxiety symptoms. The health practitioner has been lovely in trying to help us, but her hands seem very tied with the resources that she has as the waiting lists are very high. I was even shocked to learn that she doesn't have access to all the information we have provided to other people that are involved in my daughters care. It would be so much simpler if everyone was kept in the loop of a patients care plan and it not being left to the carer having to go over the same information all the time and update different parties.  
I have given permission for the Speech & Language Therapist to inform my daughters mental health practitioner of her finding and send her a copy report as I think this is necessary for her to have all the facts, when planning therapy for my daughter.  
I appreciate that the Mental Health Care system in very under funded and currently broken and I have been advised that things will change and improve in the future, but this needs to be sooner than later so children get seen quicker and offered the help they need to cope with their suffering so it doesn't escalate to the next level.  
Another point I mentioned to my GP was my concerns over my daughters school attendance as I am getting phone calls and letters from the school. I was advised by my GP in front of my daughter not to worry about school, and advised about a patient that had not been to school for 6 months and locked themselves away in their bedroom. As you can imagine again I was horrified this was said in front of my daughter as she now thinks her attendance is not an issue and nothing for us to worry about. I have told her it is a concern and she needs to be in school, but because she has been told differently by a medical professional it's hard to advise her otherwise.  
I appreciate the GP may have only being tying to help by saying there are worse of people than us and that the school have not taken action, with them, but they used their choice of words totally inappropriately, especially in front of my child.  
I believe that our GP's need more training in mental health, or there to be at least a GP that can specialise in this field within a Dr's surgery. I understand that GP's are strapped for time and their hands are also tied when it comes to referrals, but something seriously needs to change in the future, to make the whole process easier and less stressful.  
Hopefully now we are in the hands of CAMHS,Community Paediatrics and Speech & Language Therapist, my daughter will get the help she truely needs.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1476

I was terrified to be admitted into a psych unit in a foreign country far away from my family and friends, but the care I received from the moment I arrived help me settle quickly. While certainly not eating disorder specialized, the nursing staff and HCA’s did their best to support and accommodate me, including allowing me to have meals in the doctor’s office where it was less overwhelming and assisting me in filling out menus. I was very unwell for much of my stay and I recognize I was a very challenging patient trying to run away numerous times but the compassion I received throughout that time has had a lasting effect.  
Because of B2 I was able to stabilize my health and the ward facilitated excellent follow up care with eating disorder services, in turn allowing me to return to my job and complete my year in the UK. I have been back in my home country for over a year, but I still look back on my stay on B2 with profound gratitude for the patience and support of staff.

The first relationships I formed with off ward staff were at Creswell as they always seemed interested and keen to help me, there is a relaxed atmosphere as well, due to their patience approach and kindness.  
These attributes helped me to trust them and listen to their advice when I was in classes, in the past when I tried to learn I always felt criticised when mistakes I had made were pointed out which led to me feeling distressed and normally ended with me withdrawing from those studies.  
These obstacles happened a lot during the first classes here but the staff handled it so well and always showed such kindness and patience that I have overcome those challenges and have been able to carry on mystudies.

"tc","Transition/coordination","Consistency/Continuity of care","Well, after what i assumed would be a rather beneficial experience and a step toward rectifying some of my issues, i had my assessment via phone the other day. The email i received stated i would be with a specific therapist and again my assumption was that this was the person i would be building a rapport with. As a skeptic when it comes to this kind of treatment and being someone who is both very intelligent and very slow to trust, i decided to try and be as open as possible. It turned out that the hour long phone call was not enough to complete the full assessment so my assessment was spread over 2 phone calls. I felt reasonably hopeful after day 1 that things would progress nicely, and felt that my skepticism may have been misplaced. This was completely revoked by the second phone call. As it turns out, this person who i opened up to was not to be responsible for my continued therapy, merely an adviser. Things that had been mentioned in the first phone call, which i assumed had been noted, were completely forgotten, and the same monotone responses given as if it was the first time we had spoken all over again. I felt patronized, and as if i was speaking to a random call center. Not the responses i was hoping for when dealing with mental issues. After going through some very personal and distressing issues with what was now going to be a random stranger, i was further informed that i would be placed on a waiting list of at least a couple of months. Now, as someone who has been struggling for a substantial amount of time, and just now finally thinking ""i have to do something, Now"" this again was not what i was expecting. In short, what a joke of a service, what a shambles of a way of dealing with serious mental health concerns, and what a way to make someone already in a significantly fragile state feel considerably worse. I was asked during these calls if i was a danger to my self or others, while i may not have been before, if this is the type of treatment i can expect, i most assuredly am well on my way to being now.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1493

NICE guidelines are not followed and young persons under there care are put under pressure to try and get them to make up stories.  
Counsellors, I feel are unprofessional and even male counsellor felt it off putting talking to a yong person in need of crisis support when they had phoned from the bathroom for privacy. I felt the counsellor was inappropriate with their comments.  
I feel that for 3 years, a young person in need of post trauma support has been neglected, subject to bullying behaviour and told they do not have a mental health illness. Counselling support has been ad-hoc and not consistent and overall diagnosis has been refused with misleading verbal comments never followed up with the GP. Overall, do not recommend any young person to the CAMHS -my view is that they are a disgrace to the NHS.

I found it helpful as I was able to discuss issues that arose for week to week, in a supportive and validating environment. It was useful to recognise where I had lost my mentalizing and to receive suggestions on how to manage situations better in the future. It also helped me by being prompted to share my struggles, especially ones I would not normally discuss, as it helped me to confront issues I would have otherwise potentially ignored.  
I feel the therapy has impacted on my daily life in that I am better at mentalizing, maintaining relationships, better and managing grief. I am currently not self-harming and I’ve reduced my alcohol consumption to a more healthy/helpful level. I find I can walk away and hold my tongue better when dealing with difficult and testing people.

I haven't let it show because I'm not a qualified counsellor or psychotherapist but I'm not sure who it was and haven't seen the person since. They were supervising at meal time. Maybe they were not a regular staff member? I made a few observations, that the staff member wasn't as sensitive to patients as other staff. Maybe they didn't know the patient well. I looked at the patient and felt that they were not comfortable as the staff member was a tad impatient. It was unpleasant.  
Something I learnt from a former therapist, I would say don't be quick to judge people. Don't judge that person or illness, there's a person inside there. I was a bit disappointed I thought the staff member could have behaved better. It couldn't have been handled better.  
However, I've grown to respect what staff are doing and I see the results they get, and they've taken my breath away. One outstanding thing is that they get some difficult arrivals and have a duty to protect the more vulnerable patients and I noticed that they discreetly keep an eye on them. I noticed a patient get upset and threw a knife and staff went up to the patient and told the patient they had to leave the dining room. so that people could eat in peace. I was so impressed at the speed, efficiency and incredible skill that removed the patient from the situation, but they were mindful of other patients. They were aware of the sensitive patients.

I have been in the mental health service for 16 years and can say my appointment here was the worst. In contrast to the other reviews I feel the receptionist was the only one who showed any care or compassion. There was absolutely no empathy shown by the person I saw and it was very clear I was just a tick box exercise. Their excuse for this was that it is hard to type and show compassion at the same time. The funny thing was there was a student typing the notes so that is not a viable excuse!! The appointment was late, I was called by the wrong name, it wasn’t explained why I was not seeing someone different to the letter stated, the lady did not explain her role or the purpose of the appointment (basic basic skills for consultation!!). Words were put into my mouth about how I was feeling. When I asked about services that were available I was just told there are leaflets in reception if you want that. Even with those who I haven’t had great appointments with before at least they have tried to look like they care but this lady was just so blasé. Why do people do these jobs if they don’t care about people! And why do they not understand how important these appointments are to people who need them to feel like there is someone who wants to help and sees you as a human. Bad experiences like this just make sufferers feel even worse and more hopelessness!! I really hope the lady has learnt something from my appointment about how to treat patients but when I voiced my concerns she clearly did not understand my point so I doubt anything will change.

I did find that I didn’t learn much I didn’t already know. I also felt that there wasnt much support or guidance in the sessions, sometimes it felt that the sessions were too rushed/not enough time. I think this is an area of change needed with the facilitators. Sometimes I felt unheard or dismissed which was not helpful. However, I found my 1:1 worker amazing. I felt he would take responsibility for any mis-understandings and that he would take the time to actually listen and care which felt really nice.  
I am not sure what to expect going into MBT Therapy as it sounds the same as this group (support), with only the smallest support and input from facilitators - I’m not sure how this is different?","2","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1603

This personally has been one of the best and smoothest transitions that I have been a part of.

Keep up the good work you do on a daily basis!! Your patients are very lucky to have you all!!  
The only thing to improve a visitors experience who may be working on future transitions, it may be worth looking into perhaps setting up a visitor fob?

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","I recently suffered with my mental health and ended up as an informal patient at a local hospital on their acute mental health ward at Calverton Hill. I was feeling very vulnerable and distressed and didn't know quite what to expect. I spent just over three weeks on the ward before returning home.  
There is no doubt that the priority was my personal safety, making sure that I was given the time and space to allow me to recover enough to return home and that was certainly achieved. I was lucky to have my own room and toilet/ washing facilities, along with a communal lounge. I was thoroughly checked over by a doctor and nurse on my arrival and it was made clear that all the staff were there to provide support.  
Unfortunately this was not the case. Arriving on a ward like this was distressing, with very little information about what was happening, what was expected of me and I felt I had very little control over my life. When I was distressed, some staff were fantastic, supportive, ready to listen and proactive. However, many of the staff seemed to be either distracted by those patients with greater needs or simply disinterested in the patients, particularly in the evenings.  
I had to ask for my care plan to be completed, and this felt like a copy and paste exercise from other patients' plans and included numerous errors. I raised this twice with the nurse but it seems I was expected to try and catch them to identify the errors, rather than this being their responsibility. I received this plan a week before I was discharged due to 'an issue with the printer in the office'. Only later on, relying on the support of my family and friends, did I feel sufficiently able to voice my concerns, but many of the actions requested by the consultant in the ward rounds were not followed through. For example, I had stated that I found it helpful to have 1:1 conversations as talking therapy, following the support I had received from my local crisis team (who were fantastic). The doctor requested that every day I have a 20 minute 'slot' for discussion with any member of staff. This did not happen once in all the time I was there.  
Bags were not thoroughly checked and I have no doubt that I could have further harmed myself had I decided to do so. I admit I did at times take in my own painkillers to help me manage pain and this was not noticed by the staff. Being awoken by a light every two hours as part of safety checks led to my first migraines in over a year. I asked for this to stop but unless I placed a note outside my room, this practice continued. These are just a few examples of numerous concerns and issues with my care.  
Those of us who feel vulnerable are often withdrawn and unable to ask for help. Being placed in an environment that was unstructured, disorganised and at times felt uncaring made me feel angry and frustrated. I felt that because I was quiet and slept, little effort was made to engage with me or support me, and the quality of support I received depended very much on who I was dealing with.  
Keeping someone safe involves more than leaving them to sleep quietly in a risk assessed environment, monitoring and managing things purely from a pharmaceutical perspective. There was little treatment on offer that differed from strategies I was already trying and I felt no attempt to work towards a discharge other than a reliance on my own determination to get out as quickly as possible. My appointment with the psychologist was due to take place on the day of my discharge.  
I hope that things improve very soon for the lovely people who are left on the ward and am grateful to the few good staff who helped make my stay more bearable. In my feedback, I've asked if I can speak to the hospital about my care.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1609

"wb","Access","Time spent waiting between appointments","Well I'm back again to air my grievances about Stonebridge centre and Nottingham city South mental health team. I do this without malice simply to reassure those with similar issues, out there, they are not alone. This is not a witch hunt, so I won't mention any names.  
I had been seeing a CPN at Stonebridge for over six months. Following a series of demeaning meetings and what I would call inaccuracies in the subsequent correspondences to my GP, decided, (with a heavy heart) that I did not wish to see this person anymore. This was about the end of October 2019 and was established with the service manager.  
After this time my mental health took a very big downturn and I managed to get to see the current locum psychiatrist. They assessed my current mental well-being and remarked that I was now at risk . This was of no surprise to me considering the fact that I had started to hear voices in my head and just prior to the appointment had been jumping in front of traffic, begging drivers to run me over.  
I was prescribed anti psychotics and promised an appointment early in the new year.  
Well to any readers out there you won't be surprised to hear that never happened. Iam having problems with the new medication and have talked to my GP about it, but it's beyond his realm of expertise.  
What really upsets me though is receiving an appointment from the CPN I said I found too difficult to work with, in the New Year. I think, after all ive been through they've not listened to a word I have said. I cancelled this, quite rightly, as far as I'm concerned this was a wrongly deployed, 'null appointment'.  
I received a letter yesterday saying I was about to be discharged in light of the fact that I cancelled the appointment with the original CPN. There was no mention of a psychiatrist appointment or alternatives to the CPN I broke ties with last October. I have been under the Stonebridge for well over 10 years, never known it so bad especially when as the psychiatrist said before Christmas -you are now at risk","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1614

My family and I felt that we were supported by kind, caring individuals, who were available at the end of a telephone at any time of the day or night.

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","My son has been severely depressed for some time and was admitted by ambulance on Saturday having attempted suicide by taking a massive overdose of his normal prescription medication. Everyone, from the paramedics who attended him at his flat, to the doctor and nurses in A&E, to the staff on Cardiology were amazing - efficient, friendly and professional. The paramedics phoned from the ambulance to let us know where they were taking him, how he was and what they were doing (we live 100 miles away and were driving up). When we arrived at the hospital we were surprised to be able to walk straight into A&E Majors and not be challenged. Our son was conscious, but being closely monitored as he was very sleepy and his heart was going crazy (he has a heart condition and the pills he had taken were affecting it badly). A doctor came and explained he would be moved to the Cardiac ICU so they could continue to monitor him and that, if he was OK after 24 hours, he would be medically discharged but would then need to be seen by the Mental Health Crisis Team. At every stage everything was explained to us and our son. He moved to CCU and the staff there were incredibly understanding about the fact we had travelled so far and, once again, the epitome of kindness and professionalism. We left, with the staff promising to contact us should there be any changes, and we felt sure that they would. Next day our son was well enough for the monitoring to stop and for him to be medically discharged. Someone from the Crisis team then spent 1.5 hours talking to him and arranged follow-up counselling and gave him emergency numbers to contact and recommended different medication. We were horrified to learn that the antidepressants prescribed by his GP both at home and in Nottingham had been at such low doses they were totally ineffective - no wonder he was not getting better! The Crisis Team member also discussed our concerns with us. We don't know what our son discussed as the talk was in private, but he was much calmer, more rational, had a definite plan for at least the next few days and decided to stay in Nottingham although we wanted him to come home. If the follow-up care is anything like as good as the care in hospital our son will be very lucky. We cannot thank the staff of QMC enough for everything they did for our son and their consummate professionalism. In our experience of hospitals, usually someone tells you something is going to happen, such as a procedure or a move, and then nothing happens, or you end up having a procedure no-one told you about, but that was not the case at QMC. Everyone did what they said, shortly after they said it would happen.  Amazing!!","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1619

I was a little nervous at first when I was told at Amy's 2 year review that she could be referred to home talk and have someone come and support us with her speech. I was a bit worried that she wasn't saying much, but not overly concerned as she was only just two. However by the time Kim (our home talk worker) contacted me, I was more concerned about Amy and was really glad I'd said yes to being referred.  
Kim made a super effort to work around my circumstances of working full time, which made it impossible to implement the normal home talk programme. She also worked well with the fact that I worked in primary education and had some ideas of my own to try - I just needed help with modifying them to a younger age than I was used to working with. Amy made huge progress with her language over the four month period that we did home talk. She went from two words that were obvious to full sentences. At the end of the programme, home talk had succeeded and Kim was able to refer Amy for speech therapy. I got an assessment for Amy as soon as I could and after this I was really satisfied to know that both Kim, the home talk worker and the therapist who did Amy's assessment both agreed with what I was thinking, that Amy has a great understanding of language and is able to use the language well, but her speech is still lacking clearness.

Since my arrival to Rampton I have tried my best to get involved and engage in quite a lot of Rampton’s activities and socials. I am currently on the patient’s council and also the patient’s involvement group and also attend the patient’s forums. I also attend the gym, Southwell and also Creswell but what I have personally enjoyed and valued the most is the patients interviewing panel. I first took the training class which trains us ready for the real panels and this was ran by a Mrs Day with the help of some of the outside volunteers acting as candidates.  
Mrs Day made this training session very easy to follow and also with the help of the volunteers a fun and enjoyable learning experience. Also, very involved in the interview process and learning is a Mrs Alder who once again the same as Mrs Day makes this a very enjoyable but serious process. Mrs Alder does not take a view in the Decision process by patients or the marking, she does help take notes which is also real help just to make sure that as a whole we don’t miss any vital information so as not to hinder the candidate’s chance of being employed if something is missed. As I have stated I am totally for this programme as I feel that it is such an important part of Rampton Hospital and as formally stated Mrs Alder and Mrs Day make the whole experience enjoyable and they are more than respectful and supportive of all the patients involved in the interview process.  
They have made the experience more than that for me and I feel as though I'm at home spending time with my loved ones/family in a sense that it just feels normal and that speaks loads for how calm and relaxed and just how enjoyable they do make us feel. As well as Mrs Alder and Mrs Day there is also volunteers / service users who come to the interviews as well to help the process and also take notes as does Mrs Alder for the same reasons as to we do not miss anything and they are also very professional and respectful also.  
In every sense of the word they as a team amazing at the process of the interviewing experience through training to actually becoming a full fledged valued member of the team so once again as I don’t feel possible to say enough, Mrs Alder and Mrs Day and the volunteers are so friendly, helpful, respectful and professional and I can only praise them as people, as staff and as colleagues and most importantly as friends and congratulate them on a job well done and I truly hope that this catches on in other establishments also because it helps with Recovery, with team building and just being brave and confident enough to speak and ask questions. Not only this but also with motor skills in listening and writing, in taking turns to speak, in communicating everything that is needed, in concentrating and basically just getting on with others and working as a whole rather than a one.  
Not one member is more important than the others and we all bring our own skills and with that there is never anything missed. Also around 80-90% of the time the patients panel is mirrored by the actual staff/manager panel and we nearly all the time catch the same feelings about each candidate so this just proves that this process works and is functional and is also being used correctly and professionally by all individuals. I feel personally that Mrs Day and Mrs Alder do not get the praise they deserve for the training programme and the actual day to day running and working of these panels from arranging the panel to helping with all aspects of the process, without them this programme would not be the same nor would it work as well as it does.  
So in a whole I can only praise Mrs Cath Alder and Mrs Amy Day along with the volunteers and also the other patients on the panel as I am only as good as my team and the interview panels both patients and staff are more like a family than colleagues and this is testament to how both Mrs Day and Mrs Alder treat us and make us feel so comfortable at the panels so yeh once again thankyou to both of these marvellous women and big thumbs up to the whole experience and as stated before hopefully this process will catch on at other establishments as it is such a big, important part of the employment of the correct staff.  
Thank you for taking the time to read this and also thank you to all involved in the interview process, especially Mrs Alder and Mrs Day.

My son has a diagnosis of anxiety and hasn't been at school for 15 months. In the 12 months that we have been open to the CAMHS community team, his care has been very un-coordinated, long waits to see someone and then very little help or intervention.  
My son has deteriorated considerably over the last 12 months, and the strain of having a child at home all the time and not able to go to school has been considerable on both occupational and family life. I have never met any staff member at CAMHS who seemed able to consider this, the usual mantra is, you have to wait, there is a letter going out, we can offer something soon. However in reality nothing, practical, helpful or useful has been offered and when I've challenged CAMHS managers they've claimed lots was provided and tried to make me feel ungrateful or greedy for advocating for my child.  
I don't have any faith in Nottingham CAMHS anymore but the help my son needs cannot be purchased, even if I could afford it, so I am stuck, blighted by a postcode to a service which to me appears arrogant, unresponsive and totally dis-interested in providing help or support.

"cf","Care received","Carer support","I just wanted to say thank you. We as a family have been through a lot these past 3 years with me and my health both physical and mental and we’ve always had to go it alone.  
Even when i eventually started getting support mum was left to cope with me, my emotions and my impulse behaviours on her own with no idea what to say or do.  
I’m so so glad she’s had you for support. I’m getting better at not acting on  
urges but mum is now a lot better at how to react and help if something does go wrong. By you helping mum it’s made mum more able to help me so for that alone  
I thank you. When things are starting to wobble and mum needs a helping  
hand you were always there and always said the right thing. I’m trying to get  
better and it’s not easy but it’s made that little bit easier because I know  
mum has someone to offload to and to talk things through with which I think is a major help. I remember being in an ambulance with the phone in my hand after an overdose thinking do I call mum or don’t I? I was unsure she would be able to cope with yet another admission but now i know she has support it makes me being able to reach out that bit easier because I know she can cope with it.  
No one should have to cope with the things she’s had to cope with but with your support she’s been able to put that brave face on and do what she’s got to do.  
She’s been able to call for support or to ask a question about what to do etc.  
It’s sad to hear you’re moving on but I wish you all the best and thank you  
again for everything you have done for mum and for me.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1655

"ct","Care received","Therapies","I have recently ended the year-long MBT Therapy group at theMandala Centre. I found it helpful sharing, and helpful to know you’re not the only person with these feelings. We all learnt off each other, including the facilitators.  
I found that the group could bring up a lot of historic trauma without dealing with it in the group. I found it difficult keeping boundaries, especially when other group members were attaching to me. I also found it difficult when group numbers dropped. There was less sharing and less people to ‘bounce off’.  
I feel that this group/therapy has really impacted on my life/been my life! It has been challenging, but I know it had to get real to work. I was in a bit of denial at first. I have noticed that I fight against that first thought and I sometimes resort to old habits, but in the bigger picture I’ve changed massively. I’m not going round in circles anymore, I mentalize better than in my entire life – ever! And I don’t drink anymore.  
I found that the facilitators were brilliant. What has been unhelpful is inconsistency between services (e.g. Notts MBT Service and CRHT). I think CRHT staff should spend a day with Notts MBT Service. You do share notes, though not always knowledge of each other’s services.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1667

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","As someone with a whole smorgasbord of aged anxieties I was completely almost sure that talking therapy would in no way help me, I had googled my symptoms, researched management techniques, downloaded apps and probably knew enough about anxiety to write a book, I was completely convinced that I knew all there was to know and without some mind-numbing medication I was a lost cause, however I had come to a point in my life where I was being controlled by avoidance, I had lost friends, I had changed my job, I was avoiding the GP and disappearing more and more as a person.  
I self referred using the Let's talk website and was contacted quite quickly to book a telephone assessment, this was over the telephone and involved answering questions in regards to my feelings, the assessment was slightly uncomfortable and I did feel that the person on the other end of the phone was a bit cold, I was told I would be referred for CBT and that this would be a few months away, the telephone assessor said something to the effect of ""but it sounds like you've lived with this all your life so another few months won't matter!"" Ouch. It is also worth noting that if you suffer from anxieties regarding your children they will ask you about them and what school they go to, I'm assuming this is for safeguarding reasons, when I enquired about this I was only given a vague answer and I have to admit this caused me many a night googling ""will my child be taken away if I'm sectioned"", this really could have been remedied by the telephone assessor being honest about why they needed this information.  
After waiting around three months I received a phonecall asking me to go to a far flung place for my appointments, I had explained in my initial assessment that there was only a few places nearby that I would be able to attend due to crippling fear of crowds and public transport and had to push a little bit to not have to go into the busy city centre to be seen, had I not been able to get somewhere appropriate I would not have attended. At this point I still didn't hold out much hope for treatment.  
Now this is where it gets good, I had my first appointment with Chris at Strelley health centre (if you have social anxiety I recommend this place, it's partially closed and very quiet) he was friendly, calm and actually hilarious, he made me feel at ease and looking back over those first sessions he really took the time to build my trust and make me feel at ease (without reassurance!)  
Eventually we moved to meeting at Bulwell Riverside which has a bustling café and plenty of big exits for me to run out of, each time I went it got easier, we spent sessions moving between my feelings, tools I could use to ease these, my past experiences, Chris' funny anecdotes and ted talks.  
Somehow over the period of twelve sessions I went from looking at my mirror a zillion times a day, googling every last freckle and avoiding any sort of discomfort to riding the tram alone, being assertive, making new friends, being honest with my family and colleagues and just generally being the ""me I used to be"". I went from my friends having to almost putting me physically on the bus to get to therapy to actually shedding a tear when it was all over, Chris has genuinely changed my life and I would now recommend talking therapy to anyone (if you can get past the initial tough bit).","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1669
"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","This week I have been really struggling with my mental health. There have been a lot of things going on for me personally and I found myself feeling actively suicidal  
Every night this week I have put myself in risky situations and have attempted to end my life. A few nights ago I felt so overwhelmed and suicidal that after my attempt failed I rang the crisis team. I can remember crying out ‘It won’t work, I can’t get it to work’ and I was so upset that my attempt to end my life hadn’t succeeded  
I was frantic and so agitated that I was unsafe and not thinking clearly at all. Anthony spoke to me for over an hour. He gently calmed me down and made sure that I was safe. He listened and acknowledged how I was feeling and allowed me time to calm down and focus my thoughts and actions.  
He didn’t simply say ‘Have a bath or get a cup of tea’ but spent time trying to understand where I was and what was happening and what had triggered me to get to where I was  
He got me away from danger and together we talked through a clear plan to keep me safe. I knew that I could ring him back at any time during the night but I didn’t need to as I used my medication and coping strategies to stay safe after a traumatic experience  
I am certain that had I not rang the crisis team that night I probably would not be here typing this right now. He simply saved my life  
Unfortunately I am struggling so much at the moment that again last night I found myself in a risky place, cold, alone and frightened. Again, I rang the crisis team and Sue answered the call. Sue has helped me many times over the years and knows me well.  
Again, she was able to calm me down and get me home safely. Once home she stayed on the phone and made sure that I was safe and had a clear plan to support me through the night.  
In the early hours of the morning I found myself curled up in a mess on the bathroom floor after a dissociative episode. I was shaking and unable to regulate my breathing. Sue calmed me down and got me out of the bathroom safely. This enabled me to get back to bed and to get some much needed sleep  
This week has been a whirlwind of emotions and I am so suicidal and struggling. Unfortunately my CPN is off sick and my Community Mental Health Team have not been able to offer the level of support that I need. I asked for some on-going support from the crisis team as I really don’t want things to escalate so much that I end up in hospital or successfully ending my life. I am happy that they took me onto their caseload and over the next week I am going to receive more support from them. This gives me hope that I can get through this and keep myself safe

This seems not fair!One of the really sad things is the most vulnerable people in our society who deserve the best care have historically fared worse and now it appears to be happening again. My Son had a tribunal set for next week but with all the uncertainty we have no idea if this will go ahead and it appears he may now spend much much longer as an inpatient than necessary.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1721

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","I've recently completed a course of six cognitive behavioural therapy sessions at the Oxford Street branch of Let's Talk Wellbeing in Nottingham.  
Since attempting suicide during university in 2013 I have been struggling with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and have sought help in the form of both medication, and talking therapy/counselling, both of which have had no effect in treating my depression and as a result I haven't been able to pursue my goals and live a fulfilling life. Throughout this time CBT has been recommended by mental health workers and doctors, but I have struggled to access it due to waiting lists and being transferred between different mental health teams and services. In November 2019 I self referred myself to Let's Talk about a month later had a telephone assessment and a CBT appointment in January, at a date, time and location that I could choose.  
I constantly found the sessions to be unstructured, sparse (in content) and inconsistent. For example, a homework would be set one week, and treated of little importance the next (not linking it to any particular goal, skill etc.) and wouldn't be brought up until I mentioned it, but at other times when I struggled to complete the homework I would be made to feel guilty, and the therapist would continue assigning the same homework rather than trying something different. From the homework that I was assigned, I did not acquire any new skills that were effective coping strategies or techniques that lead to an improved behavioural outcome.  
When I did communicate my negative thoughts, the therapist didn't challenge them, but enabled them in many cases. For example, when I explained that I was anxious about making an academic appeal with the university ""because I feel like I have let down the university and wasted the opportunities that they have given me, even though they have already made plenty of allowances for me"", I thought to myself that I had finally said something that might be ""usable"" and that we would start doing the cognitive behavioural thing I was hoping for , but they didn't do anything to challenge that particular thought pattern and the avoidance that it leads to but instead treated it as if it was a casual conversation and expressed sympathy for that view point.  
The therapist didn't support me in a long-term goal that I have been struggling with for a number of years (it is one which I have previously made successful initial steps in but struggled after that). When we discussed the problem, there was absolutely no challenging of the negative thinking that surrounds it.  
I often struggled to express myself during the sessions and felt judged for this. It may have been partly due to the fact that I wasn't able to establish a relationship of trust with the therapist in the small number of sessions, but I think that this was contributed to by ineffective use of questioning by the therapist. Whilst I understand that open-ended questions probably have an important role in avoiding dictating to patients and giving them freedom to express themselves, the reliance on that particular style of questioning didn't work for me. As somebody who is introverted and has difficulty when talking about emotive and sensitive subjects I have an instinct to give the least that is possible when asked general, open-ended questions (not sure if they were technically open-ended questions as I'm not an expert on questions but that is how I perceived them as they seemed to lack precision). To me it seems clear how this open question style might disadvantage a range of personality traits, behaviour patterns (i.e. avoidance), people with differing abilities to express themselves for a variety of reasons and I feel that this where I struggled with counselling/talking therapy and was hoping that CBT would offer a more structured and investigative approach so that I would feel supported in communicating more of my thoughts.  
I'm not saying that as a patient I should take a passive role in the CBT, but asking the right questions in order to gain an understanding and insight is surely the bread and butter of being able to help to find a solution to any problem. I've had a quick browse through some of the other stories on this website about Nottingham IAPT and at least one other person describes the sense of the therapist ""not getting to the root cause"" of an issue.  
Being asked ""What can I do for you?"", ""what would you like to get out of this session?"" etc. at the beginning of each session contributed to a sense of non-continuity, and that we weren't working towards goals and developing skills and made me question whether they remembered what was said in the previous session or whether they had taken adequate notes.  
During the sessions they would ask how they were doing as I'm sure they could sense that I was struggling to communicate but this just added an additional role that I had to carry out when I was already struggling with trying to ""perform"" what seems to be required as a patient (I've written more about this idea later). I should add that I wasn't deliberately withholding information from the therapist, it's only after a period a reflection that I have some sense of why I acted in a certain way and what could have helped. It's disappointing that the therapist didn't seem to have the skills or framework to analyse the situation and find potential solutions for my lack of communication and instead seemed to judge me for it.  
When a discussion did manage to arise in the dialogue that we had did not contribute to any new understanding on my part. I didn't learn anything insightful about my mental state or thought process from the therapist, and often it felt like the responses were rehearsed rather than being relevant to my situation - I would agree with the assessments but they were quite general and something that I had already recognised in myself, and these assessments weren't really linked to anything else, I wasn't given the skills or techniques to challenge these particular thought or behaviour patterns.  
They kept telling me that ""CBT wasn't suitable for me"" or that ""I wasn't ready"", without explaining why or what the alternatives might be. They would often contradict himself and retract things that were said in a previous session. The therapist complained that they were ""doing too much work"", adding to my feelings of guilt and the sense that I can never be helped, and if they were doing any work I didn't feel like I was benefiting from it. The sessions would often leave me in tears (which I expected to happen as it was advised that this might be a possibility on the appointment letter) but I wasn't given any techniques to deal with this and it wasn't used as an opportunity for learning.  
There wasn't anywhere I could go to collect myself and calm down when I left the sessions in tears, apart from the only bathroom which was a single-stalled bathroom which opened directly into the hallway. I was lead to believe that I could potentially have more sessions if I wasn't making any progress, but was discharged because I didn't make any progress.  
After each of the interactions I've had with mental health workers I come away with a sense that there seems to be some specific performance that they are looking for, even though I am unable to quite put my finger on what that performance might be, my ability to carry out this performance seems to be a necessary condition attached to the quality of care provided. I was finally given a clue to what this might look like at the end of the final session (I was trying to make sense of all of the contradictions being made so was losing focus of what they were saying) but the therapist talked about me re-referring myself in several months time and had ideas about what those therapy sessions might look like - saying something to the effect of ""You're going to learn things about yourself which you won't like/ you will learn that you think things about yourself and won't understand why you think that way/ it will be difficult but when you are ready you will share with other people"". I found it fascinating how they didn't seem to have planned the next week's session but was able to glimpse months into the future to tell me what my therapy would look like. It seems to be at odds with the sense of flexibility which I suspect they were trying to create (depending on which week it was), but which was ultimately an illusion.  
Even as someone who suffers from persistent negative thoughts, I would never have thought of my self as helpless and usually retain a sense of hope that things will improve, which is what leads me to seek help from mental health services and self-refer for CBT. But unfortunately the repeated, unsuccessful interactions with mental health ""professionals"" is increasingly engendering this mindset - I'm starting to get the sense that I am trapped in a web and the more that I do to try and escape, the more tangled I am becoming and it is has added a new element to suicidal ideation. Increasingly I am thinking that I am in the wrong for hoping or believing that anyone can help me and the deleterious effects on my mental health that I am experiencing are a natural outcome of such a foolish assumption.  
The service which was supposed to alleviate my long-term mental health issues and has caused more harm than benefit, and I am left with little to no support in the aftermath. I went into the treatment with an open mind and determined to make the most of the opportunity only to be completely disappointed and let down by the service. I have wasted time which I can never get back and feel like I've drifted further from my goals than I have ever been during the course of these sessions.  
Whether it's an institutional problem, an academic problem or simply one of quality assurance it's safe to say that until there is a (visible) system of accountability for mental health workers then I believe little has changed since the time when lobotomies were a common treatment for mental health patients.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1736

"cs","Care received","Advice and support","Home Talk has completely changed our lives. It has been amazing. Before Charlotte came to help my child with her speech, my child suffered from lots of tantrums- constantly, she couldn't communicate her needs and I couldn't understand her. It left us both felling upset and I felt completely defeated as a mother to the point where I was finding it difficult to leave the house in case she had tantrums outside. Additionally my child struggled with her relationship with her younger sibling- always becoming frustrated and same with my husband.  
Since having Home Talk we have been given the tools and advice on how to communicate and how to help my child communicate with us. It has honestly been a miracle. It took just a little change, nothing like we expected but it made all the difference. My child's speech has improved so much that she now is able to talk to us- asking what she wants, explaining what she sees and even constantly singing. With this her tantrums have stopped, she is so close to her sister and my husband. Our home is just so much happier and together. Honestly before Charlotte came, I really was at my witts end. She really saved us.  
I would finally like to add that it really was because of Charlotte's hard work and dedication to her job that helped us so much.

"cs","Care received","Advice and support","A year ago I was a complete shell with nobody to turn to and kept my thoughts and feelings to myself, after all, I was the one that had children so surely as their mum I was responsible solely for their health and wellbeing. Being a mum is the hardest things I've ever done, but definitely the most rewarding.  
7 years ago I suffered multiple miscarriages and 2 ectopic pregnancies resulting in only having one fallopian tube. To myself and my husbands surprise we went on to have 3 children, two boys and a beautiful girl! .  
I felt guilty for not knowing how to manage my 3 children aged 4 and under and then I met Kath. Kath is a support worker (or as I like to call her, god in a dress) It was obvious when I first met Kath she wanted to help and completed a family star with me and it was only then that I fully understood how much id been struggling. My husband is a work away lorry driver and my boys have additional needs.  
Kath first suggested the programme and I was sceptical, id already done a 123 magic course and felt that it had failed (probably because I thought we were a lost cause and nothing would change, I just thought my children were naughty and out of control). Kath suggested the Solihull approach and once again I nodded my head and thought, just complete the course and then you can go back to solitary and ignore everybody, little did I know without realising Kath was becoming my go to person, emotionally and physically she brought me back to life.  
I was at my lowest and at my wits end trying to spin all of these plates knowing one of the boys had autistic tendencies and the other ADHD. Two very very different individuals with a number of things that worked and didn't work for them personally.  
Every week Kath contacted me, spoke with me, guided me and ever so slowly put me in touch with people that could help me. I trusted her and as Kath said ""give it a try what else have you got to lose by trying a different technique"", she did it. I was put in touch with every single solitary person that could help myself and my family.  
Months on I now have the understanding, patience, knowledge and confidence to ensure my children have a solid routine that I am in control of not the other way around. I used to brand my children, and often say ""no im not trying that because one understands but the other doesn't"" when actually the programme taught me that if I didn't try how do I know? I now treat the children equally within family circumstances and give them the same boundaries and praise, whilst remembering they are still individuals.  
Kath was the one person in a thousand that I trust with my life. She never rushed me she let me cry, she told me every single day how amazing I was doing. She encouraged me when I saw her on courses I attended and most important she LISTENED. sometimes Kath didn't have the answers, but I can guarantee within 24 hours id have a phone call with a solution. She never forgot me, she always made me feel like we were the only family on her case load and always answered the phone.  
My marriage, mental health, children's health and happiness are right up back to where we were 3 years ago. I know not everyday will be perfect, and some days I will still want to cry or feel exhausted, but as kath taught me ""if you're exhausted, that means you're doing your absolute best, well done you"". Thank you to Kath, the only person who managed to drag me out of my hole, and not just for the current time but going forward. The children's centre have changed our whole family dynamic for the better and for that I'm forever grateful.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1746

They clearly have my welfare at heart. I am now on weekly visits but I know I can ring them for support at any time, which I have still done when I've had wobbles.

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","Last weekend I was struggling with my mental health and unfortunately self harmed and had to attend A&E  
I am currently shielding so it was a difficult decision to go to the hospital but I know that I needed some help  
When I booked in at reception I felt very judged and the person taking my details rolled her eyes and said to someone else ‘self harm!’  
I was quickly taken to another area and put in a cubicle that only had curtains between them.  
The first nurse that I saw was very understanding and talked to me and even made me a cup of tea which was really nice. They seemed to understand what I was going through  
Then the doctor came and looked at the wound and said it could be steri stripped but I explained that I was allergic to them. They said that they would get the theatre nurse to come and have a look. I was surprised that this doctor was not wearing any PPE  
A person came from DPM and made a statement as they walked in that they had seen me before. They sat down and asked me what had happened. I tried to explain that the cubicle was not very private and I had heard full details of other patients ailments so was reluctant to explain what had happened  
This staff member flippantly replied that the doctor was not going to treat my wound and I was to leave. They walked out  
I waited for another hour but no one came so I just left. My wound was open and bleeding. I was very suicidal and stood by the river instead of going home  
The crisis team calmed me down and made sure I got home safely  
I have spoken to a manager at DPM who is looking into this for me  
However I had to wait until the next day when the District Nurses cleaned my wound and pulled it together  
Today I am really unwell. My wound is badly infected and I have a temperature. My GP has just given me some antibiotics  
If the staff at A&E had cleaned my wound and dressed it then I feel that I would not be so poorly now.  
They showed no care for my well-being  
The wound is red and swollen with the redness tracking from the wound and I am concerned that I could get sepsis as I have had this in the past  
I want to know why my wound wasn’t cleaned and why the doctor told the DPM professional to send me home  
In the future I am unlikely to go to A&E for support when I am struggling or when I have hurt myself

The CBT sessions were brilliant & I gained useful tools which enabled me to change my mind set regarding how to cope with stress & anxiety. There was one particular session of CBT which talked about perfectionism. It was a eureka moment for me as I realized these traits in myself. Suddenly a I felt a load had been lifted from my shoulders! As a result of this CBT session I changed my mindset which in turn improved my well being immensely.  
Alongside the CBT sessions I had regular contact with Sanpreet, one of the employment support advisors. This regular contact via the phone was invaluable! Sanpreet spoke to me & guided me when I was at a really low point. Sanpreet was brilliant and the advise she was able to provide regarding employment issues helped me enormously on my road to recovery.  
The Employment Support Service, alongside the CBT counselling, has been really beneficial and I am pleased to say that I am on the road to recovery.

"cc","Care received","Care received","I was invited to write this by one of the brilliant NHS workers that I encountered during my elderly mother’s recent illness. I hesitated at first to share my thoughts because they are not all positive, and such observations might not be appreciated during this horrific coronavirus crisis. But actually, that is exactly why I have chosen to share this story: I think it is important that we don’t dismiss all NHS shortcomings as a consequence of the COVID crisis. I am afraid, and to be honest I expect, that all issues during these times will be parked at the door of ‘this unprecedented situation’. Whereas, in my opinion, COVID has not caused these issues, it has simply exposed them.  
At the beginning of the story mum was a relatively healthy 81 year old, living at home, with some memory issues. She became ill at the beginning of March with diarrhoea, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, mental confusion and disengagement, and was advised in a GP consultation to ‘stay hydrated and take paracetamol’. A couple of weeks later, since she was becoming very weak, I called the GP and my mum was prescribed (over the phone) antibiotics for a suspected water infection. After a further week of deterioration, I called the surgery again. At this point my mum could not walk, stand, or even sit up in bed. She was quite incoherent, and had fallen heavily 4 times in 48 hours. On reflection, I probably left it a bit late to call again, but no one wanted to bother the NHS at that time. The GP came to see her and arranged for her to be admitted immediately to A&E at the QMC.  
This is where the whole experience of the NHS, became rather distressing for me and my dad. The ambulance crew were great, and encouraged me to go with the ambulance to the hospital, since mum was pretty confused and poorly. I arrived at the hospital with the ambulance but I was not allowed in – no visitors were being allowed in, and apparently this had been the case for a few days. Of course this made sense, but the ambulance crew told me that they had not been informed of the policy. They were as frustrated as I was. I went to the A&E reception and was given a phone number to call later, once she had been ‘booked in’. I called that number, and other numbers that I could find on the internet, including the QMC main switchboard, repeatedly during that afternoon and evening…but no answer. Plenty of advice on COVID via pre-recorded messages, but no one answering the phone. I tried again the following morning, but with the same result. We didn’t know where mum was, never mind how well or poorly she was. Quite by chance, the staff member that invited me to provide this feedback, called the following lunchtime as part of a regular follow up, and offered to try to locate mum. They managed to do this, thankfully, and I was able to call the ward and speak to a nurse. That was the Tuesday. I managed to speak to a doctor for the first time on the Thursday. In the meantime, updates from other staff were vague and ambiguous, and promises to return calls were not met. I was told that mum had had some scans, but the nurse was unable to tell me what sort they were: not even X-ray vs MRI. It just seemed like visitors were banned but no one had put in place any type of substitute communication protocol.  
When I spoke to the doctor, I got a few more facts, but it was clear that they was not familiar with the case notes either. In fact, another member of staff told me that there was no way that any of them could read the notes. I must have recounted mum’s story to the staff there on more than 5 different occasions to different people. To their credit, when I told the doctor that mum had a brain scan scheduled before she was admitted, and that this it would be a great time to get that done, it was arranged. I was also told that she had been taken off one particular medication because it was causing some side effects (low sodium). But we had been through this exact cycle a few months earlier. Back then, the GP put her on it, the hospital took her off it. The GP put her back on it, and now the hospital is taking her off it. When I asked the doctor how we could get out of this cycle was told I should discuss with the GP. This is where I just don’t think the system is patient centric. This was one example of where the various departments don’t talk to each other. In effect I was being asked to liaise between doctors on a medical judgement. I get it that the hospital concern is more urgent and short term, and the GP is probably looking at a longer term picture, but mum doesn’t live her life in two separate compartments: long and short term. She needs the best overall solution with whatever compromises that brings, but it seems like the organisation isn’t set up to facilitate that. A further example of this lack of continuity was that when the brain scan was done by the hospital, I was warned that they would not interpret it, we would have to go to another department, at another hospital, to get that done. It may appear to be efficient that way, but it hardly puts the patient needs first, in fact one is tempted to think that it puts the needs of individual NHS departments first.  
To my great surprise, I received a call from a Staff Nurse on the ward that mum was in, that Thursday evening. I was given a long apology for the way we had (not) been kept informed. I don’t know what prompted that, since I had never asked for an apology, and I had tried hard not to pester the team there. I restricted myself to one conversation a day, on behalf of our family and mum’s friends, just to check that mum was ok, even if that took 5-10 calls to achieve.  
The following day/night, mum was transferred to the City hospital. To this day we don’t know why. I was informed of the transfer by the team at QMC and give a number to call. Again there was no answer to the number that I had been given. After a day of repeated calls, I dialled what I deduced was a neighbouring ward to see if I could establish a line of communication. An incredibly kind team member there offered to go herself to the ward where mum was, and gave me a new number to call. This time I got through, and was able to re-establish that mum was comfortable. But that was about it, no insight whatsoever into what the problem was. By this time she had been in hospital for a week, and the nearest I could get to understanding the problem was that ‘almost any symptom can be a result of almost any cause’, to paraphrase what I was told. I will be totally honest here, in my more frustrated moments, I interpreted this as, ‘we haven’t got a clue, but the sooner we can eliminate a couple more issues, the sooner we can get her out of here and onto the next unconnected part of the NHS’. It’s a bit of a cynical view, but it was a genuine feeling.  
After her unexplained stay in the City, mum was transferred to Lings Bar. Things did improve here - greatly. The staff were happy to explain what was going on. The OT and physio people called back. The switchboard worked. Despite the context, it was a very good experience. After a few days in Lings Bar, mum began to improve. We don’t know why, but she did. The team there recommended that she be discharged home, with a 4 x per day support package from the START team (apologies if my terminology is not accurate). Mum was certainly significantly better, but one particular problem remained. For the first time in her life she had become incontinent: doubly incontinent. The team at LB advised me to call mums GP surgery to get an incontinence assessment, advice and supplies. From there, I was referred to the Community Incontinence and Prescription team, and from there to the District nurse, who told me that they were only doing critical visits due to COVID. I asked if there was any provision for newly incontinent 80 year olds just discharged from hospital. I was told ‘no’ and advised, and I quote, ‘to buy pads at the supermarket’. It wasn’t a question of cost or convenience, I simply didn’t know what I was doing. So we searched on the internet, bought pants, pads and a Kylie! I learned a few new things in that period! To a healthcare professional this might seem like a trivial condition, but for me, my 87 year old father, and mum, none of whom have any experience of the problem, it was a big concern. Mum is still waiting for the assessment.  
We don’t know if any of mum’s health issues were caused or exacerbated by COVID, to our knowledge she was never tested.  
It’s a minor matter, but maybe one that isn’t obvious from inside the NHS: my phone costs, just for calling the hospitals, amounted to about £80 during that time. The repeated pre-recorded messages, which you have to go through even if no one subsequently picks up (about 50% of the time), actually cost quite a bit.  
Mum is much better now, enjoying life and brilliantly cared for by a local care agency. I want to thank the many people who tried so hard, and were so dedicated to her care during this period. But I also want to call out the disjointed, under-resourced organisation that is the NHS. It seems to me that sometimes it simply isn’t fit for purpose. The dedicated people delivering stunning care, are doing so despite the organisation, not because of it. I desperately hope that the failings that have been exposed by this crisis, are tackled properly once we are through the worst, and not all excused by this ‘unprecedented situation’. I am not that optimistic though, I fear that the politicians will praise the NHS as a whole, and fail to separate two components for different treatment: the brilliant people, and the disjointed, under-resourced organisation.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1790

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","I saw first specialist last August after GP referred me May/June. She said she was referring me to Nottingham City Autism Service (as per the procedure). In February I learned that the referral had not been made and that I had somehow 'slipped through the net'. By this point Corona was on the horizon.  
I eventually got a phone consultation with Notts specialist 2 weeks ago. She informed me what a complex procedure diagnosis is and that due to Corona I am now looking at another year to full diagnosis.  
She did say she would send me details of support groups to help with anxiety the waiting is causing.  
Yesterday I received this. But one of the services is for 'people who identify as female'. I had specifically said in my consultation that I'm non binary. So not very helpful. The other service says it's for people with a diagnosis. So no idea if they will accept me.  
Just went on to the online survey and in gender options it only gives M / F or 'prefer not to say'. I was forced to tick 3rd option, as if I'm ashamed of my non binary status. Which is not the case at all.  
To be fair the actual consultation was ok and I should give a shout out to Dr Maliks secretary at Milbrook because she did try to push things through for me quickly when we realised I'd got missed.  
But there are issues with how this service is caring for diverse gender identities.  
Last thing - I have been given an appointment back at Milbrook in December, but I'm told this is not at all related to my diagnosis. So what is the point? Surely they should give that slot to someone waiting for 1st referral?","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1818

Some would think I’m happy to be leaving, especially with me “starting a new life” and “moving on” as I’ve been told. Truth is- I’m actually going to miss this place in a weird way. Especially certain staff, the ones that I actually trust, and the ones that have helped me overcome so much! Even when I didn’t feel like life was worth living! They still pushed and helped me feel some what human.  
They’ve embraced my weird obsession with weird things (stickers, hedgehogs)  
Not with judgement but understanding that when it’s to much I use them to cope.  
Here is a thing I wrote in my book when I first came here:  
_“Anyway the staff again a lot like Harry Potter, (I’m not sure on names) but you have some bank staff- dementors, they try and talk to you until one of the ‘professors’ get rid of them. Especially when they are new. (I don’t like new people, they scare me.) _  
_You have Hagrid aka boss man Paul, he’s great! A few of the nurses are a lot like Luna! (In a good way!)” _  
I feel scared about leaving here, yet I think coming here in the first place (even if it was on a section) was the best thing for me. As I’ve learnt so much! And I’m willing to give life another try. I’ve got to fight! I’ve learnt a lot of techniques which should help me. And most importantly I’ve learnt to respect myself. (Which is really hard!)  
I wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for the staff on Lucy Wade!  
Thank you all! For everything!

"aa","Access","General","My dad was a patient on Rowan 1 recently. I went to visit him having arranged this with a member of staff one morning while he was there. The member of staff I spoke to informed me that I would be able to use the family room to see my dad from 16:30-17:00.  
I had not seen my dad since he had become so acutely unwell and, needless to say, was anxious to see him. The last few months have been some of the most difficult my dad, my mum and I have ever experienced; largely due to my dad becoming so unwell. I arrived at 16:30 as arranged and waited outside In the rain having pressed the buzzer for reception. No response. I then pressed the buzzer for Rowan 1, which I also got no response to. I was waiting for 8 minutes with no response which was upsetting in itself as it was eating into time with my dad.  
I would like to add at this point I am a student nurse and have 6 years experience as a health care assistant so I am certainly not oblivious to short staffing, busy wards and time constraints, however being on the receiving end of being left anxiously waiting to see a loved one for so long is not a nice experience. I also understand emergency situations occur meaning staff have their time further taken up. However, I saw plenty of staff around when I actually arrived - one of which was sat down around a nursing station area where I assume the buzzers are answered. Then, a person who looked like a doctor was leaving the building and without saying a word just swiped me into the building. How fortunate is it I have no intent to harm vulnerable patients as this would have been easy access to say the least.  
I then walked round to the ward as I assume I had to collect my dad and take him to the family room as I wasn’t given instructions to state otherwise. I was, again, allowed on the ward freely and could see my dad instantly as I arrived on the ward - he was looking upset and panicked. As I went to walk to get him and he was walking towards me a very abrupt and stern member of staff put their arm in front of my dad to stop him walking towards me and told me “quickly, come in”! “Shut the door quick!” And also tried to physically stop me entering as though my dad was an aggressive man trying to randomly leave the ward? When I explained that this was my dad and I was visiting him this staff member said they thought I was staff, and shouted that I had to get out! And walked towards me intimidatingly to usher me out. Again, how poorly regulated and how fortunate I wasn’t someone with intent to harm a vulnerable patient group.  
By this point my dad was saying “they’ve told me I don’t have a visitor” before the door was shut on us both. I would like to point out my dads section was lifted at this point. I understand now that visitors are not allowed on the ward having spoken to my mum who has visited several times, however this was not explained to me prior and no one would let me in the building or answer the buzzer to explain where I had to go. My dad was then escorted out to meet me where I was “greeted” by another abrupt and stern member of staff who literally shouted “TWO METRES” (as we walked on opposite sides of the corridor to one another).  
We were escorted to the family room where our time together had already been eaten into to then be greeted by a confused family member who rudely asked what we were doing there. Through an unpleasant interaction we found we had each been told that we had booked the room. The staff member heard this and said nothing.  
My dad, extremely upset, anxious and depressed having attempted suicide multiple times over the past few months in some horrific ways was mortified and already distressed by being told by staff that he never even had a visitor today - there had been a very clear cut lack of communication amongst staff. By this point I ended the visit with him and was too upset to even attempt speaking to the rude and unapproachable staff member that had escorted my dad out of the ward. I would also like to mention I was told to wear a mask upon entering the hospital and the family member who interrupted the time I had with my dad was not wearing one and had her arm around her family member in front of the staff member. I, on the other hand, had been shouted at like a child “TWO METERS” whilst walking on two separate sides of the corridor.  
My dad has described the hospital as a “prison” and told me “it depends who you get” “they are so disorganised and don’t communicate nicely” when I asked if the staff were treating him kindly. While I understand it is a secure unit for adult males who have been sectioned, this is disturbing to hear.  
As a an experienced student nurse I am beyond mortified and disgusted. Ironically, I had bought a box of chocolates and a card to give to staff as a gesture of appreciation for “caring” for him. I appreciate the hard work and determination it takes to be a nurse. How I wish I would have saved my money.  
I believe the staff on Rowan 1 need training on communication and how to speak to and treat people like autonomous, adult human beings. Pure insult to injury has been added to a truly traumatic time for us as a family. To be clear, I will be taking this as far as it needs to be taken and will not stop before we are given an apology and are told what is going to be done about the issues I have raised. I, for one, will always advocate for vulnerable patients who may not be able to speak up for themselves. There is no excuse for poor care, period.  
I have also witnessed staff members stood outside the ward smoking cigarettes and chatting away on their phone on their break where family members are entering and leaving. I agree with my dad in that the staff appear disorganised and unprofessional.  
After I wrote the above, I was shockingly informed by my mum that just before my dad left Rowan 1 he had a staff member come to him in a confrontational manner saying they had “beef"" with him, accusing him of refusing his meds 3 times that morning, and in my dads words, was “in his face”. My dad was sleeping that morning due to sleeping tablets he has was given the night before having an effect and that is the reason he didn’t take his medication.  
Needless to say I was disgraced to say the least. My dad gave me the name of the member of staff who acted in this disgusting way towards him and I rang the ward wanting an explanation. A manager called me back after being in meetings all day and said, stuttering over themselves and clearly constructing a story as they went, my dad had maybe been taken the wrong way because the member of staff said “no beef"" and had told him not to worry about not taking his medication that morning. The manager confirmed they were not there when it happened and they were going off what the staff member had told them.  
My dad would NEVER lie about something like that and is an extremely anxious and none confrontational person. Having seen how the staff there talk to people and how rude and unprofessional they came across to me I find it perfectly believable.  
I hope and pray that no one else’s family has to endure that kind of behaviour and go through what we have gone through and the hell my dad has had to endure at the worst time of his life.  
I am contemplating taking this to the care quality commission or at least the NMC. I hope members of the public see this and speak out at the first sign of something off on that ward.  
There are other scenarios I would like to complain about however I will leave it here as these are the ones that have stuck most in my head and upset me so much.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1833

"cc","Care received","Care received","This is regarding the Children’s Center services at the City Hospital Campus - Hucknall Road  
My son was referred to a speech and language therapist due to eating difficulties. The therapist was unhelpful from the start- just printing off advice from generic websites for us to use. They spent less than 20 min with my child not in an adequate setting to find out feeding issues. They only gave one piece of advice to say ""chew"" to him when he eats.  
After that initial visit- I had to beg for more help. My child was displaying extreme responses to food which included phobia behaviours and self harm. I asked the therapist on numerous times to come and witness his feeding at mealtimes but they said that mealtimes wouldn't work with their schedule.  
I called on numerous occasions for help and it took over 2 weeks for them to get back in touch. When we finally did- the therapist offered very little support. They agreed to refer us to a feeding clinic for more support if he hadn't improved in a few months. He didn't improve and we were taken off the list with no access to the service & informed us they couldn't help us.  
I begged the therapist to sign post us to somewhere else. Instead they contacted social services and made allegations that I was starving my child, I was making up the disorder and I myself have an eating disorder. They had no evidence of this & is not an adult mental health professional and the remarks are slander. There was no research done or watched him at mealtimes at home.  
Thankfully- social services and all other professionals have been outraged by these allegations. My health visitor has witnessed him since birth struggle to feed.

I approached my Health Visitor for advice as my son's lack of speech began to cause behavioural problems. I was referred to the Home Talk service where I was put in touch with a lovely woman called Hazel Clark. I suffer with severe anxiety and can honestly say not at one point did I become anxious or distressed which is very uncommon for me! Hazel made me feel comfortable enough to speak about sensitive situations which I could not speak to other professionals about regarding my son's concerning behaviour. She helped me discover new ways for me to cope and manage my son's speech development and always gave me reassurance of all plans. But before long we both realised my son  would need Speech Therapy in order to make further progress.

"aa","Access","General","I phoned yesterday to local mental health teams. Although, I was promised a call back, none came. So I phoned again today. I wanted to know why my relative was refused help from a crisis team.  
He seems in a crisis and without help, his crisis will probably get worse. The crisis team did not wish to clarify their decision. Indeed, the crisis team would not give the name of anyone I spoke to so I can only say I spoke to an admin person.  
I said that this seemed like fobbing me off rather than helping me to understand the basis of the decision. When I commented that this seemed like a poor way to deliver a service, I was offered the chance to speak to a nurse. But the nurse was busy so I would have to wait for her to call me back. So this could be an even more effective way of fobbing me off as I haven’t had a call as promised.  
Of course, it’s not much fun on the front line in mental health services during Covid.

During lockdown the first anniversary of my stroke occurred (which meant that support would be withdrawn anyway, this meant I missed out on about five of the twelve months support. Worse still it meant that all the objectives and future targets also went, which was a big mental blow. Surely the support period should have been extended by the lockdown period.

If I ring within the opening hours, but at the wrong time of day, and the doctor's secretary has finished for the day, there is apparently, no way to leave a message.

I accept that many publicly funded services are overstretched but surely the ability to make contact is a basic requirement of offering a service.

I have to attend my local Community Mental Health Team base every fourth week for a Depot injection. Since lock down we have to book an appointment as Clinics as I understand it have been suspended. The last few times when I have rang I have been unfortunate enough to be answered by a receptionist who talks to you like you are a 5 year old. This week I tried to return a call to the centre but they wouldn't put me through and spoke in a patronising way. When I did eventually made it to get my injection I had to wait outside the building for 10 minutes (luckily it was a nice warm and dry day)while the nurse prepared the injection. My disappointment and anxiety from having to wait was enhanced after the encounter with a nurse who can only have spoken to me at the most 20 words. But NONE of those were asking me how I was. Forgive me if I am wrong but surely as mental health nurses their patients welfare should be up near the top of the list when speaking to them. The fact that I didn't know the nurse is irrelevant if this is a new member of staff surely its a way of getting to know the patients. I have recently gone through and still am struggling. It was obvious my notes hadn't been looked at.  
Previously I had known a lot of the staff there but they all seem to have moved on. I can only say how disappointed I am in the treatment I have received lately.

"wa","Access","Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service","I feel horribly let down by the mental health services I have accessed.  
My last experience of therapy was two years ago at Step4 thorneywood. I waited nearly two years for this therapy (this is after being passed around from 3-4 services), which I was told would be specifically for dealing with trauma, but when I got there I was told that it wouldn't necessarily be that, which caused me to feel really upset as I had been holding on to the idea of getting therapy for my trauma to keep me going.  
I persisted anyway, and basically the majority therapy amounted to talking about routines and before I started therapy I was in the routine of meditating every day and starting to do things, but the disappointment and lack of support led me to feel even more depressed and once again unable to engage with the things that were helping me. The first week that I went into therapy without meditating, eating breakfast or able to have a caffeinated hot drink as I woke up late but thought it would be better to just go in and not miss my session. This meant I was struggling to engage with the session as I was not fully awake. The therapist decided to change their demeanour with me this day and accused me of smoking weed before coming in which I would never do, and didn't seem to believe me that missing my morning routine was the cause of my fogginess. I nearly burst into tears and left but the terror of having no support once again kept me there.  
After my sessions were finished, I felt worse than when I started, and was told that I could reapply again and wait another 2 years on the waiting list to be seen again. I was also told that I would be put into a mindfulness group therapy there but then they just never contacted me again and left me with zero support.  
I feel despondent, as everyone else I know with a mental health diagnosis has been through very similar situations to me, and everyone tells me they weren't listened to or understood. I was diagnosed with BPD about 3 years ago or so and I only found out about my diagnosis at highbury when I went in for an appointment and they started talking about my ""personality disorder"", which I was not aware of at all before that point!

A male staff member JB on Emerald ward has helped me during these COVID times. I don’t like masks they scare me, but he said that its still me and he took his mask down so I could see who it was. Don’t worry there is nothing to be worried about. The reason we wear these masks is because we see other people outside the hospital so its to keep patients safe JB is a really good member of staff, he is really supportive when he is on shift, and when I’m upset he talks to me and cheers me up, and he helps everybody else out. I think he really deserves some recognition for what he does for everyone.

It’s just whenever I phone up the service (which is not often, only phoning on 2 occasions this year) and this person answers the phone I get the phone slammed down on me without any enquiry as to the state of my mental health.

I expected this would be taken into consideration, but it really wasn't. Unfortunately I cant mention the name of the counsellor I had, because I would hate for someone else to have to endure that person. 
I had my initial appointment with this person, and I had a feeling he wasn't really interested in what I was talking about. They asked me to repeat myself several times, before recommending I join an online platform, which quite frankly, did nothing. 
My next appointment with my counsellor was worse by far. I was on the call for no more than 10 minutes, and they re-recommended I use the online platform. clearly My counsellor wanted to spend the additional 50 minutes of our time, having some sort of break.
personally I struggle speaking to people about what I have going on in my head and this person made it even worse for me. They were not engaging, or able to help me open up about my problems.

"cs","Care received","Advice and support","Hi. I have been under secondary mental health services at the Stonebridge Centre for a few years now.  
I had an appointment recently with the mental health nurse that I am under. This person reviews me every few months.  
I suffer from emotionally unstable personality disorder. In the appointment, I had described my struggles coping with change in my treatment with occupational therapy. I struggle with change. I struggle dealing with feelings of abandonment.  
Toward the end of the appointment the nurse questioned if being under secondary mental health services was right for me at this time. They suggested that being in the service keeps me in ""sick mode"".  
This triggered me quite badly. The nurse observed this. I became really tearful and disconnected because it triggered a lot of intrusive thoughts.  
Unfortunately for me this was 5 minutes before the appointment ended.  
I don't question their motives for asking these questions. They are the professional and might be right in what they are saying.  
What I found completely unacceptable, was ending the appointment with me in the state I was in. I was extremely vulnerable and felt judged and dismissed. Being left to deal with this on my own should not have happened. If I had been in this state at home, triggered by something else, it would have been a time I reached out for support from the centre. But how could I when they caused it and dismissed me?  
I don't know whether it is wrong for me to expect the nurse to sit with me to ride out the emotions while they were so intense? I don't think it's alot to ask or to expect.  
I am now left untrusting of the centre whilst I'm in a very vulnerable state of mind.  
I hope this doesn't happen often in this centre. They are meant to be the ones who help in these situations. Not cause them.","-4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1901

"cc","Care received","Care received","Two nights ago I had a particularly bad night and found myself extremely distressed and in a vulnerable position. I rang the crisis team and although the person I spoke to ensured the immediate danger I was in was resolved they did not follow my crisis plan and left me still distressed curled up on the kitchen floor  
The following night I woke up to find myself extremely upset after another distressing event. I rang the crisis team and spoke to someone I had not spoken to before who through my distress told me to go and have a bath. I explained that I had deep wounds that meant I was unable to have a bath and if mental distress was resolved that easily we would have bath houses and not crisis teams. They did not look at my notes or follow my crisis plan and left me still distressed and overwhelmed. In my distress I curled up on the bathroom floor and cried. A few hours later I hurt myself and rang back where yet again I did not receive a lot of help  
Next night at 12am after a vivid nightmare and waking up in a wet bed I rang the crisis team again. I was upset and felt unsafe. I stressed that I didn’t want to hurt myself like the previous night but felt the same way as I had previously. The same person as the night before again told me to have a bath and I reminded them that I couldn’t. They basically told me to use distraction techniques and left me curled up on the bathroom floor  
I curled up and cried. I felt overwhelmed and frightened for my safety. I hadn’t been able to ground myself and they hadn’t followed my clear crisis plan  
I rang 111 in distress and spoke to some very supportive people. A nurse rang me back and I had to go through why I was struggling which was very triggering and upsetting. She said that she would ring the crisis team and ask them to look at my crisis plan and ring me back to support me.  
She spoke to the crisis team and explained how I was feeling and they said that they would ring me back within 2 hours!!!  
Later on I was shivering on the bathroom floor in distress for three hours. The crisis did not ring me back for several hours. I was shaking and crying and feeling very overwhelmed and unsupported.  
This makes me feel unsupported and very unsafe. I was advised to ring 999 if I couldn’t keep myself safe but I feel that I don’t want to have to go through my distress all over again. It makes me feel worse.  
I have written a clear crisis plan for the team to follow that supports me and is very effective. I know that new people join the service from time to time and they don’t know me. In my distress it isnt always easy to explain how I am feeling and I need help to ground me and to get me to think of a plan to keep me safe. I didnt feel safe that night.  
I have been struggling with my mental health more so than normal recently

"cc","Care received","Care received","I’ve been struggling with depression and signs of anxiety for just under a year now, it had gotten to the point where I’d had enough and tried to overdose. I took a large amount of thyroid medication and no one noticed for a few days. I didn’t think I had taken enough and thought nothing was going to happen however I slowly developed chest pains, my heart sped up and after walking for a little while I struggled breathing slightly. When my family found out I was taken to the hospital and had to stay for a number of days. I was attached a cardiac machine all the time and had a few ECGs so they could monitor my heart and was on medication day and night to get my heart back to normal. I had regular check ups where they checked my temperature, blood pressure and heart rate each day.  
I didn’t really have an appetite whilst I was there, despite the food being not the best regardless. I’m only 15 years old and had no one staying overnight with me, it was really lonely and most nights I found it hard to sleep because the light in the hallway was on and I wasn’t allowed to close my door so it was always really light. Days had past and my heart was going back to normal so after having a session with their local camhs I was discharged. I still struggle with my mental health and in all honesty don’t think I’ve progressed at all from that stage. Camhs are supposed to be helping me and they do try but nothing they do seems to have much impact. The only thing I can see them really helping with is reducing my timetable at school.

"sa","Staff","Attitude Of Staff","In 2016 I had a complete breakdown (very severe episode of recurrent depression) and attempted suicide. After 4. 5 months in a psychiatric unit I came out, but was still not very stable, and I deteriorated and was admitted again for a month in June 2017.  
After discharge I was under the care of Manor Road Local Mental Health Team, and saw a succession of locum psychiatrists and one CPN consistently. I didn't feel like any of these clinicians listened to me and heard what I needed - they each had their own narrow ideas of how to help and refused to consider alternatives or the reasons why they wouldn't work.  
I'd been under the care of the Specialist Depression Service previously, and they were willing to take me on again if Manor Road would refer me to them. However, it took 6-7 months for Manor Road to get their act together and refer me (clinicians said they'd never heard of it, despite SDS sending them a letter asking them to refer me), by which time I had deteriorated again, mainly due to having my antidepressants stopped and being put on semisodium valproate by a (seemingly incompetent) psychiatrist in 2017.  
My time with SDS has been the complete opposite. Dr Nixon is incredibly kind and knowledgeable about medication and treatment protocols, and he listened to what I had to say and took my views into account when deciding on medication. He gave me full information about all the options and monitored me closely and effectively when I needed it. I had a short course of therapy in 2018 with Anne, who applied CBT using a standard protocol, which didn't work very well, but she then retired.  
After a gap and a further change of medication I started receiving therapy in 2020 from Richard. He is by far the best therapist I've ever had - he applies CBT intelligently and changed his approach to best fit my needs. When I was diagnosed with autism recently, he took that into account and has tailored sessions (led by my feedback) so that I can get the best from them. I have made great progress so far, and I anticipate that this course of therapy is going to be truly life-changing, as are the medications I'm now taking. The support SDS give is not limited to the 6-8 sessions you get from IAPT, it's tailored to the individual, and it's been demonstrated to be much more effective in preventing relapse. I can't recommend them highly enough, I wish more secondary care LMHTs were aware of their service.","0","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1962

"ti","Transition/coordination","Coordination/Integration Of Care","My 17 year old son developed symptoms of severe depression 10 weeks before his 18th birthday. His GP prescribed an antidepressant and told us that they would like to refer him to CAMHS but couldn’t because he was too close to being 18 when the adult service would take over. Suggested some NHS counselling services but when contacted they replied that they were unable to offer him anything until he was 18. He deteriorated further and 2 weeks later had a serious suicide attempt, ending up in hospital. He was told he would see a DPN from CAMHS prior to Discharge. He waited 6 hours for someone to come who told us that they were actually not a proper member of the crisis team. We asked about his ongoing antidepressant medication and were told that it would be discussed at the crisis team MDT the following day and his GP would be contacted. He was made a follow up appointment with the crisis team 10 days later.  
The outcome of the MDT was not communicated promptly to his GP who had to chase it up and in fact was advised not to give any further medication - however, fortunately our GP started another drug anyway. The follow up appointment was with a ‘practioner’ and health care assistant who offered no suggestions for treatment and was a total waste of time. They again told us to contact the counselling services who had already turned him down. Our GP received no communication from them and tried to speak to a consultant, but this was unhelpful.  
He has remained very ill and has had absolutely no treatment offered by CAMHS for 8 weeks. My husband and I both work within the NHS and in both of our services there is proper provision for 17 year olds to transition across to adult services. The CAMHS service needs to improve this quickly before more young people in their moment of need are failed. We have the resources to take matters into our own hands and have arranged a private psychiatric review and private counselling for our son - many others would not have the resources to do this.","-3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1964

"ap","Access","Provision of services","Around this time last year, I made plans to end my life as I felt overwhelmed by depression and anxiety and couldn’t see any way through. I was lucky in many ways that I had excellent support from an NHS counsellor, who took steps to secure support from the crisis team (who were also amazing) as they spotted that I was becoming very unwell. Although things worsened, I was enormously grateful for the reassurance and support that the crisis team provided. I ended up spending a few weeks in hospital and was discharged back to the crisis team and then my local Community Mental Health Team. Then the pandemic hit.  
I expected there to be an impact, but as mental health was being more widely discussed in the media and workplace, I felt increasingly invisible. I know full well that I am not the only person who needs support, that others are struggling around me and services have had to adapt to cope. But this NHS that I passionately defend is failing me. Instead of getting better, I feel at breaking point again with nowhere to turn.My current support consists of periodic phone appointments with a lovely Dr, where my medications are reviewed and a brief attempt is made at reassuring me that really I am on a waiting list for some therapeutic support, but without an indication of how long this will be. There have been various errors made with medications, promises of support made that haven’t happened and the chasing I have had to do to make anything happen at all, at a time when I feel at my most vulnerable. The cold reality of the situation is best summed up by my conversation with a senior staff member at the CMHT team who told me that of course I was important to them, but they were busy dealing with other priorities such as actively suicidal people. And then went off to deal with something else. The message seems to be that to get any support, you really do need to be actively trying to end your life.For nearly a year now I have fought the urge to do just that, and I can’t tell you how much it saddens me that a professional responsible for my care did not understand the significant impact their words would have on someone who went into hospital rather than take that option.I know there is no magic wand with mental health, but I have asked for help because I need it.

I was feeling very anxious about this as a first time mum.  
I can honestly say we could not of asked for better, Hazel took time to get to know my son and myself even my 1 year old daughter at the time.  
Hazel has always been there if I needed advice to point me in the right direction.  
I Followed Hazel’s advice and we together made massive improvement with my son's speech and his all around behaviour.  
Hazel is brilliant at her job, some people you can tell it’s just a job but Hazel engaged so well with us all.  
Made me feel at ease, I never felt rushed or judged.  
Hazel did more for us a family than any other help professional has to date.  
We were extremely lucky to have Hazel and we will miss her greatly.","4","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1975

They are all nice ladies and they give you advice and more confidence to do things. I don't think I would have done if I didn't have the support.","3","Care Opinion","Care Opinion - Q1",1976
